We went to the resort for our honeymoon, and reading some of the reviews, it made us sceptical of where we were going.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
I dont know what people were complaining about, because we had absolutely NO problems with ANYTHING there!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
We went to the steak house (La Cava) and it was great!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The presentation was awesome and you get large portion meals there.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
Only I would recommend eating INSIDE the restaurant, instead of eating outside...I got bitten by some flies/bugs out there (about 30 bites on my legs, which were VERY itchy).	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
We also tried the Mexican and Italian restaurants.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
My husband and I both didnt much care for the Italian food, however many others seemed to enjoy it.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
Our favorite was the Mexican restaurant, in fact we ended up going there twice during our stay!!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The buffet was quite well...we really enjoyed the omlettes in the mornings!!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
There was a LARGE variety of foods to choose from at the buffet and they all had good flavor.I would HIGHLY recommend getting the VIP package....its worth the few extra bucks!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
With this you recieve a VERY relaxing massasge, premium brand drinks, and lots of other little extras.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
However, you have to mention to the bartenders that you are VIP and tell them that you want 'Brugal' rum (the better rum), and the more expensive vodka...otherwise they might mistake you for NOT being VIP and not receiving the better alcohol.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
Our room service from our maids was great, but it also helps if you tip them.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

We spent half of our stay sun-tanning on the beach, and NEVER had trouble finding a hut or chairs to sit on...dont know what other guests were complaing that they couldnt find a place to sit by the beach.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The other half of the time we tanned by the pool (the one with the swim up bar).	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
There we had to wake up a bit earlier to find chairs to sit on.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The sun seemed hotter by the pool, but then again you dont have the ocean breeze blowing and cooling you down....which was nice, because we both got bad wind/sun burns sitting by the beach one afternoon.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

It was no problem at all dealing with them about this issue.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
They were more than willing to either re-book us, or return our money back IN FULL.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
We decided not to re-book seeing it was one of our last days there, and heard from others that went on the tour that it actually wasnt worth the $80 american/person.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
They didnt have entertainment on the boat ride at all and never saw ANY fish on their whole tour.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

We did ALOT of walking along the beach everyday there, and thought that our resort had the best part of the beach BY FAR!! It was clean and had the most huts and chairs!We would definately go back, and to those of you who are going you'll have a blast!!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
Extremely friendly place	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.8
We stayed in the two-bedroom villa at Ixora and found the place to be comfortable, perfectly maintained and relaxing.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.8
The staff were as friendly as you'd find anywhere, and the German owner was always accommodating and friendly - giving us an itinerary and booking a driver for a day trip, as well as offering us a lift into town whenever we wanted.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.8
Some people on tripadvisor have stated how the villas are 'out in the sticks', which seems a little churlish as transport is dirt cheap and you're really not far from anything.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.8
If clubbing in Legian is your thing then, fair enough, this may not be what you're after - but if you're after a relaxing holiday where you can take in the island at your own pace, you could do much worse than stay here.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.8

We were treated great from the time we walked in the lobby,we had to wait for a room but it was well worth it! We got an upgrade because it was my husbands b-day while we were there and they knew this ..We had a fun- vacation laughing alot at the entertainment group ,they are an asset to the hotel,Black Banana and Leo kept the pool area and beach hopping and they were all good!! We thought the food was good and the weather couldn't have been better.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8
The evening shows(adult) were fun too...The pool and beach are wonderful,clean and only complaint was the saving of the shade huts,we had to do it too because the sun is intense.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8
.Don't know what the complaints from other reviews were all about they must be really picky!!!	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8

Great modern hotel away from the action in Barcelona	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
Great hotel for business conventions (part of the reason for my trip), but far from the life of the city.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
In a nutshell, the hotel amenities are fine, staff are friendly and very helpful, the restaurant is good and the rooms are comfortable.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
A spa/restaurant/pool on the 13th floor is very nice, although I got a bit tired of Hollywood theme songs played at somewhat annoying volumes.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
All rooms have a view of either the ocean or the city.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
The only complaint I have is the location.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
The Diagonal Mar area around the hotel is one of Barcelona's interventions (urban renewal project).	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
Nearby is a shopping mall that is indistinuishable from malls anywhere around the world.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
I would recommend the tappas bar on the far east end of the terrassa, or explore the sidewalk cafes north of the mall.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
Access to the city is through bus 41 (about 35 mins to Pl. Catalunya), the yellow metro line (15 mins to Jaume station near Barri Gotic), or a tram that takes you to the Olympic Village via Pl. Glories (about 15 mins).	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0
Taxi access is very good, located just outside the hotel.	1.0	0.2	0.8	1.0

We booked our trip to Japan through a Japanese travel agency and this hotel was part of the package deal.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
It is a good location in that it is near the Shinjuku station, which is one of the major subway and JR line stops.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
There is also a free shuttle to and from the station, which helped (though the walk isn't bad).	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0

We stayed here twice - a few days when we arrived and then a few days before we headed home.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
Service was great and we used the concierge service numerous times to find good restaurants around the area.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
It's a hit and miss with staff speaking English, although for the most part they understood us.We only ate breakfast at the hotel, which was a Japanese and Western style buffet that was excellent.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
However, we skipped eating restaurants on the second floor as they were a bit pricey.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
If Tokyo is the only city you're visiting I'd probably recommend a different hotel as Shinjuku is a business district and pretty quiet at night unless you hang out at the station (the shuttle service ends around 9:30PM).	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
If Tokyo is one of many cities on your agenda, I thought this was a great choice.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
Only downside is the JR to Kyoto/Osaka leaves from Tokyo station, so you have to change stations if you venture west.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0
I strongly recomend getting the JR pass if you do so.	0.8	0.8	0.8	1.0

A top choice in Barcelona	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I spent two nights at the Casa Fuster from 26-28 November.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I had spent two nights at the Hotel 1898 on Las Ramblas before checking in to the CF, and although a night in a Standard room at the CF was 110 Euro a night more expensive than a Superior room at the 1898, the CF truly is in a different class than the 1898 and is worth the extra money.I should say however that a local travel agent quoted me a rate of Euro 240/night inclusive of breakfast at the CF for the weekend of November 17th, but I ended up having to change my travel dates due to work.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
For the days I traveled 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
even though I did not stay at the CF on a weekend 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
were much more expensive 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
at Euro 330/night not including breakfast.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Obviously, it would have been great to get the cheaper rate, but I would pay the higher rate again for a chance to stay at the Casa Fuster where the service and the accommodations are truly top notch.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Let mention that I have a love-hate relationship with large hotels.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I like the hustle and bustle of crowded lobbies and get kind of depressed when I am staying at smaller boutique hotels that have empty-ghost town lobbies.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
That doesn鈥檛 mean I am a fan of large numbers of tour busses dropping off tourists to gawk and gape while they wait in line for afternoon tea.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Still, my second impression of the CF (the 1st being the absolutely stunning building exterior 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
wow!)	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
with bellhops coming and going and groups congregating all over the lobby was 鈥渘ow this is a real hotel鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I would say that the CF and the 1898 are of similar size, but the lobby of the CF was much more lively than the 1898 although they both had high occupancy during my stay.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The 1898 does have a somewhat larger lobby however so this may account for why it seemed so sparkly populated.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
After check in I decided to walk around town a bit.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Of course, the first thing I noticed as I was walking back up Pasaig de Gracia towards the hotel was a Large grey tour-bus parked outside the hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Oh well.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Guess you cant have the crowded lobby without the obligatory tour bus parked outside.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Still, this lobby was crowded in the way I enjoy so I cannot fault it Although I expected the Standard room at the CF to smaller than the superior room at the 1898, the room at the CF had a very, very large, luxurious marble bathroom reminiscent of the bathroom at the Hotel de Russie in Rome.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I think the bathroom is the most important part of a hotel room and would gladly give up extra room real estate if it would buy me a larger bathroom.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
You could comfortably fit two people in this bathroom which I appreciated even though I was traveling alone.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
In fact the entire CF reminded me of a smaller version of the de Russie.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Something about the decor, and the layout of the hallways though I can鈥檛 put my finger on it.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I did have a minor problem with the shower 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
either there was no shower curtain or glass panel to keep the water from spilling all over the place, or I just count figure out how to use it, but I ended up making a minor flood in the bathroom that I had to use up all my towels to dry up.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Thankfully when I returned to my room the attendants who had done turn-down service had replaced my wet towels with fresh ones.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Although the CF felt from the start like a real deluxe experience, it proved itself to be such on my very first night there.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
After a long day of sightseeing in the area around Palau Nacional I wanted to enjoy a glass of wine in the Lobby bar before heading off to dinner in town.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Regretfully, there was a private event going on at the time and the gentleman at the front desk apologized and offered to have me served in the upstairs library-quite area which I happily accepted.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Shortly after finding a place to sit where I could write my postcards a waiter appeared to take my order.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
When he returned her informed me that the glass of wine was 鈥渙n the house,鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
which could not have made me happier.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Very unexpected and very, very nice.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Skeptics might say that a small gesture like that is not worth the extra Euro 110/night over my other choice for accommodation, but to me it makes all the difference.I did eventually make my way to the lobby bar after midnight where I enjoyed a glass of Cava, finger foods, and deserts.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The later was on the pricey side but no more than I expected to pay at such a fine hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Although I would stay at the 1898 again, if I budget was not a constraint I would choose the CF hands down.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

This was my second trip to BCN and some of the TripAdvisor members warned that the area has become a lot more touristy than in it was in 1997, I didn鈥檛 really find that to be the case.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Still, L鈥橢ixample is not all that far away from Placa Catalunya and Pasaig de Gracia is really so nice to stroll along 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
leisurely or otherwise.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
There is no reason to stay on Las Ramblas.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Even if you are not a walker, the Diagonal Metro station is only two stops form the Ramblas.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
A note of caution for those of you who only travel by car or taxi: At 11 AM on a Monday morning to took over 30 minutes to travel from the Hotel 1898 (on Las Ramblas) to the CF.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I could have walked to the CF in just over half that time if I didn鈥檛 have a large suitcase with me.I would also like to try the Hotel Majestic, which is only 2 or 3 blocks from the CF and so many Trip Advisor members have spoken so highly of it.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
But I wouldn鈥檛 think twice about staying at the CF again.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I cannot fault the experience 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
well maybe the 5 pound room key system REALLY does need to be done away with in favor of a keycard 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
but otherwise it was truly wonderful.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I never made it to breakfastas I had saved that for my checkout day but ended up having to check out at 4:30 AM due to a last minute change in my travel plans.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The reviews on TA are a little bit misleading for the CF.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I noticed a lot of people gave the CF 4-out-of-5 while nearly all the reviews of the 1998 are 5-out-of-5.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
These reviews, coupled with the uber-cheap rate I was originally given for the CF, made me originally want to avoid it.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Too often have I stayed at a 鈥済reat鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
hotel at a steep discount and regretted doing so.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I was seriously afraid that the CF was past its prime.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Thankfully the CF was everything I expected 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
actually better b/c it surpassed the 1898 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
truly a tough act to follow 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
in so many ways.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
But I would explain the stellar reviews that the 1898 gets by saying that it probably exceeds people鈥檚 expectations as a 4 star hotel while it sounds like the CF sometimes does not live up to people鈥檚 expectations.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I would say that the CF met my expectations in every way and exceeded them in certain ways as well.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The 1898 may be a better value because it is much, much more affordably priced while offering many similar amenities and services.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
But there really is no comparison.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
These hotels have a different vibe 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
that of the CF is decidedly more up-market.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Of course most of the tourists in both hotels were Americans and the dollar is just not what it used to be.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I believe people are judging by 鈥渂ang for the buck鈥?鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
as Euro 300 is now worth closer to $450 while it once was as little as $240..	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
a whopping 87% increase in 6 years.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
That is no small consideration.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The CF is amongst the best in Barcelona.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I hope to eventually stay at the Majestic and may find myself at the Hotel Arts at some point, which I visited for lunch one day and felt like I was in Battery Park City, NYC 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
totally cut off from the rest of the city.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
And what鈥檚 up with the lack of a restaurant on a high floor?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
How could they forget to utilize the best amenity they have, and charge dearly for: the stellar views!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It must be reserved for hotel guests (no less than one nights stay is the cost of admission to what is probably one of the most spectacular vistas in the Mediterranean).	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
And they probably want to avoid the afternoon tea phenomenon 鈥?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
not that I blame them.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
In the meantime, the Casa Fuster will be for me the best place to sty in Barcelona.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Hopefully it wont take me 10 years to go back to BCN like it did this time.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

Breakfast: Actually, not bad at all, I enjoyed it (even though I did feel as though I waas sitting in a chinese resturant, very odd.Rooms: It seemed that they had crammed as many beds in each room as possible, I had 4 single beds in my room, I have no idea why, I was taveling alone.	0.4	0.0	0.2	0.0

My wife and I stayed at the Dia-Ichi Hotel Tokyo during the last week of July 2006.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
I would just like to echo what some of the other reviewers have mentioned, particularly the quality of the hotel and its great location.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
The Dai-Ichi Hotel Tokyo is across the street from the Shimbashi train station (there is actually an underground connection), which in addition to a couple of subway lines also has the Yamanote JR train line which is great for getting to the various sights (the Yamanote line is a circle line that runs around central Tokyo and is covered by the JR rail pass).	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
This means that if you are coming in from Narita airport all your have to do is take the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and then get on the Yamanote line and travel two stops to Shimbashi.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
In addition to great transportation, there are also numerous restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding streets, including a full supermarket in the Shimbashi station.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
As has also been mentioned, the hotel is only a 15 minute walk to the fish market which is very handy as the action there starts before the subway begin operation in the morning.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
The hotel itself was very nice; equivalent to a 4-star business hotel in North America with well appointed and relatively spacious rooms.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
The staff were very helpful and there always seemed to be at least one staff member available at all time who spoke English.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
We got a very good price for this hotel on Expedia (CAD$160/night) - a price/quality combination that we would be hard pressed to match in any North American hotel.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
The only word of caution would be directed towards very light sleepers as the hotel is next to the train tracks and at times some noise can filter through to the room.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0

Ritz (except the fitness center) Have stayed in Ritz/Four Seasons properties in several cities and this one followed in line; prompt service, individualized welcome card upon check-in (not that I need that kind of thing), clean, comfortable room and beds - and the requisite Ferraris, Porshes and Escalades parked front and center with the valet.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Still ticks me off that the Ritz and other 4/5 star hotels charge an extra $10 for internet access, but guess most are just expensing it through on business accounts anyway, but just include it in the room rate - I can get free access at Best Westerns!!!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Two things: firstly, Fisherman's Wharf is a really bad location to stay in, in San Francisco - none of the best restaurants are in the immediate area, and Fisherman's Wharf itself is a tacky tourist trap (even San Fran residents are embarassed about it).	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0
Secondly, if you must stay here, the Holiday Inn is dire and should be avoided.	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0

Hallways and room are best summed up as having the appearance of 30 years of Spring Break cavorting without a cleaning, stains on all walls, carpets, and furniture, typical dark W hallways and rooms, poor towels, overpriced water ($8 per bottle), staff with attitude at the front desk, car valets were very good, flies join you for your beakfast without invite, food stains all over the restaurant menus each time the last three stays, $3.25 surcharge for using the ATM and limited to $100 (what will $100 buy you at a W hotel?),	0.4	0.6	0.2	0.6

Tues nights) I visited the Royal Grove on 05/20-05/23; aside from the weather, which was generally overcast with some light drizzle, I had a great time during my stay in no small part due to the Royal Grove.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
I arrived at the hotel and checked-in at around 3pm; my cousin, with whom I was sharing the room, arrived at around midnight (after his flight was delayed) and had no problems checking into the room after I informed Christy that he'd be arriving later.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
The really cool part about the stay (aside from the great price and the proximity to the beach) is the jam session that took place on Tuesday night.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
The owners (the Fongs) invited some of their friends over to jam to some Hawaiian tunes on some ukuleles, an acoustic guitar, an electric guitar, an electric bass guitar, and a set of drums.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
The music was pretty sweet as was the impromptu hula session given by the (daughter-in-law?).	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
After the jam session, I had the chance to meet the Fongs, who as it turns out, have owned the Royal Grove for about 40 years now.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4
Although they still own the hotel, the Fongs leave the day-to-day management up to one of their sons, Tim, whom I also had the chance to meet.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.4

We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertown's sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to.	1.0	0.6	0.8	0.8

We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no DVD players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one.	1.0	0.6	0.8	0.8
They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms.	1.0	0.6	0.8	0.8
We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen.	1.0	0.6	0.8	0.8

There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location (right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop) to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.	1.0	1.0	0.8	0.8
I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt) and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished.	1.0	1.0	0.8	0.8
The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?	1.0	1.0	0.8	0.8
I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue?	1.0	1.0	0.8	0.8
I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.	1.0	1.0	0.8	0.8
Total Disappointment...	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
Stayed three nights at Sofitel last week.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We were underwhelmed with check-in.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
First night there was no top sheet on the bed only a thin comforter.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The third night, same deal, no top sheet on the bed.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that I'm guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We thought that was a little odd for a king room.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The clock radio was not a CD player and it didn't pick up one station.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly can't see it from the hotel.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
We asked the concierge if she had a map of Reagan Airports layout and she replied no.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
There is one restaurant across the street, a steakhouse, and three tourists on the street advised us not to eat there.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8
However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery.	0.6	0.4	0.4	0.8

At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
But when you arrive, the room was great.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Thoroughly modern, great views (we were on the 31st floor).	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Service staff were very polite and helpful.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
We chose the express bus.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train (fast and cheap).	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Easy.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum (recommended).	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The dessert place was very good as well (also recommended).	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
Around the hotel are many shopping places.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0
The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls.	1.0	0.8	1.0	1.0

We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

The non-smoking room was well presented, clean with good quality furniture, towels etc.The bed was simply the best Hotel bed we have experienced - just so comfortable.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The room was serviced twice a day which meant when you dropped back to the Hotel (great location 鈥?	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Why was the Sofitel New York so different and so good?	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Nice Base for Exploring	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Call us cheap, but we said no thanks and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The next morning (Saturday) at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We had a nice room on the 25th floor.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The room was 4-star, but the lack of services (e.g. pool, gift shop) make the entire property a 3.5 star.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Still, it was a great value and the location can't be beat.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Everything is close.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We shopped at Macy's and went to Walgreens for our snacks.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Both are a block away.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent!!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods (near Walgreens) for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge (atop the Drake Hotel) for drinks and dancing.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Both places are highly recommended.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

Not exactly a gem	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
If I had to travel to San Francisco again, I would only stay at the Hotel Union Square if it were again the only place I could find.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
Here's why:The hotel is old.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
Nothing wrong with that, however, little has been done to update the facilities to provide for modern conveniences, save for the free high speed wireless internet.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
The water pressure was low, the bed was average, the decor was spartan, and the bathroom was quite small.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket (along with a few drinks that were for sale) and was also meant to be used as a work space.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
It was not really useful for anything due to its size and number of functions that it was supposed to perform.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
Again, the bathroom was small and the toiletries provided were average at best.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
For some reason, I had a bag which included a Harlequin romance novel and a woman's razor included in my provided toiletries (thanks for the free stuff, Union Square Hotel, but I'm a guy).	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
The location was VERY convenient, both to BART, the cable car lines, and the F streetcar.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
Many attractions are also accessible just by walking.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
Although the location is great, not much has been done to insulate the rooms from the noise of nearby union square.I paid just under $200/night for this hotel.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
If I hadn't been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, I'd say it was fair.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8
For any time of normal demand, I'd say that anything less than $120 would probably be a good value.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.8

We asked when we checked in, the were unable to accomodate as hotel was at capa city...ok...so we wanted a late check out as check out is at noon and our flight didnt leave until 6 pm, clerk said that we would have to come back the day before we left to do that...so we did....again unable to accomodate as people would be checking in at 3 pm.....so again I wasnt happy ....but on the other hand the location of our room was perfect Block 35.....the only thing we needed the tram for was the beach.....everything else was a 5 min walk.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Overall I would recommend this hotel lots of activities throughout the day to keep young and old busy and entertained, though for the single party type travellers this may not be the hotel for you as most activities are done by midnight......We will use the resort again when it is time to head back to the Dominican....	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

We stayed at Hotel Renew for four nights, December 22 - 26, 2008.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Our overall experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this hotel property, with one caution that I will address later in this review.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The hotel is small --- 83 rooms --- and does not have a restaurant.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
However, there is a lovely lounge just off the chic lobby where a hearty Continental style breakfast is served every morning (included in room rate).	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The breakfast includes fresh island fruits, juices, coffee/tea, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Just enough to start the day!	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The decor of the hotel's public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Room window are large and can be opened for fresh air, and 25% of the rooms have private balconies featuring a small table and two chairs.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The hotel is spotlessly clean.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The hotel's location could not be more perfect if you don't need to stay directly on the beach.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queen's Beach (just two blocks from the hotel to the South).	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Both beaches offer restroom facilities.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The hotel staff is among the best to be found in Hawaii.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Everyone we encountered during our four day stay was attentive, friendly, welcoming, and extremely professional.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana (Hawaiian for family).	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
However, if you plan to take an afternoon nap, bring ear plugs.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
If you are looking for a smaller intimate hotel with excellent quality bedding and furniture and a warm, welcoming staff, this is the place for you.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0

It's really good to be able to walk out the back of the hotel and right onto the beach or onto the beachfront walkway for biking or rollerblading, and it's rare in SoBe unless you're paying top dollar.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The 2nd time we stayed we were upgraded to what was called a deluxe room - larger then the room we had before and it also had some other features like tea/coffee, a wardrobe and side tables.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
The lounge area was opened and looked great - We were able to get on the internet, cook a meal and also wash some very dirty clothes.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

La Luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame.	0.6	1.0	0.6	0.6

A complete steal.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

It takes about 45 minutes to get there from the Punta Cana airport.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
When we arrived (close to 3pm) our room wasn't ready.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I was not happy about this but since we were starving our main priority was to eat.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We went to the Supreme, one of the resort's buffet restaurants.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We ate there during most of our stay.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We tried two other restaurants but the Supreme seemed to have the most options.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I can't comment on those.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
As for the others, the food was okay.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We had no food related sicknesses during our trip.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I tried a lot of different dishes and found that most were okay and a few were really good.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I wouldn't come back here if I measured this trip solely based on food but check the other reviews for comments on the two reservation only restaurants (Le Gourmet and Matsuri) because the food their might be really good.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We spent our days going back and forth between the beach (absolutely beautiful clear water and white soft, sand) and the pool.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
For both the beach and the pool, if you want a chair under a palapa to cover yourself from the sun, I suggest you get their early (between 8 and 8:30) or before you have breakfast, take your towels and leave them on the chairs you want.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This way they will be held until you return.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We didn't always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I simply cannot express how beautiful the beach is.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The photos on their website come close but in person it is something else.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The pool which goes up and down the length of the resort is so big that at times you feel like it is your own pool.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
No matter where you are in the pool there is a bar close-by, not to mention the swim-up bar.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
All of it is absolutely gorgeous.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
They have bridges going across the pool at different spots, just beautiful.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The service, whether being given by the front desk attendant, housekeeper, mini-bar refiller, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, managers, porters, security personnel, or towel attendants, is exceptional.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
You are treated as though you woke up that morning as Queen Elizabeth.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
My sister and I are a bit shy and like to keep to ourselves.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The bartenders/waiters are so friendly that they ask you not only if you are enjoying yourselves but where you are from and so on.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
They might have spoken to my sister and I more than others because we speak really good Spanish and this would pique their interest as to where we learned to speak the language.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
So for most people who are not social anxiety-prone this would not be a problem but instead a plus.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Even though this turned us off a bit (again for people who don't mind a lil small talk this is no big) we decided that we would still like to come back beacause of the sheer beauty of the resort.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Even if you do not have an ocean-view or poolside room, you are still surrounded by such beautiful gardens and fountains.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Please remember to tip the staff.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
They'll give you great service regardless of how you do or don't tip but they are not paid very much, work twelve days in a row with three days off in between, and our tips make all the difference.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
You will find a lot of Germans, French, and Spaniards visiting this resort.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Mainly Europeans with the balance being Canadians and Americans.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
A lot of families and couples.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Not big with the young, single crowd.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
If you are young and single you are probably going to want to go off the resort for the clubs.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Taxis should make this no problem.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Otherwise, they have nightly entertainment.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
A movie at 8pm, a show (usually a performance of some kind) at 10pm and an on the property disco/sportsbar after the performance.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The shows are pretty good.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Whether it is cheesy/funny or just plain good, you will enjoy it.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
During the day they also have activities you can participate in led by the animation team.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This was disturbing because the guest had reservations and were there for a wedding but for some reason there was no room.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I don't know if this is a common occurrence when vacationing but it happened to them.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Even with that knowledge the place is so beautiful and they are so nice, I want to go back as soon as possible.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

Some earlier reviews describe this as sterile and I can see that some people might see it that way.Location is good for business and holiday; close to Town Hall train station, walk to downtown area, Darling Harbor or Circular Quay.I can use the executive lounge which serves complimentary cooked and continental breakfasts, snacks and drinks during the day until late.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8

Zeta bar is a good place to invite colleagues for a night out - long lines on Friday night so it's popular with the locals as well.A friend with an assistance dog shared the room last stay.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.8

Quiet, modern hotel	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
We loved several things about the Ayre: (1) it is QUIET.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
You hear no noise from other rooms or from the hallway.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Our room did not face the street.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Ask for one that faces the interior.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
(2) it is clean and very modern in decor.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
The rooms are large.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
(3) the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
(4) the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced (and delicious) caffe con leche and pastry.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isn't much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you don't bring your laptop, using the hotel's computers costs 6 euros an hour.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Even going down the metro escalator steps at a good clip with my husband behind me, someone slipped in between us and opened my backpack.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someone's camera.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
We felt more unsafe in Spain than in any other place in Europe.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where they're trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police don't care that tourists are being preyed upon.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6
Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, don't carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, don't let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.	1.0	0.6	1.0	0.6

Outside a cab was ready to take us to the Vitale, we arrived there within an hour of touching down, to be greated by a member of staff who clearly had more important customers than us, she simply told us that our room wasn't ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00pm, it was currently 12.30.After a long journey I expected a better welcome, afterall the hotel know which flight you're on and when to expect you.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.0

I had very high expectations from what I had read about the resort in the Internet.	0.2	0.0	0.8	0.0
I soon discovered things were a bit different.	0.2	0.0	0.8	0.0
First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ($120 round trip for 2 adults).	0.2	0.0	0.8	0.0
The building and the bungalows are very pretty as well as the pool area and the mountain view (it's the rain forest called Yunque that can be seen from the pool area) sadly, the outdoor lobby where the main desk is located is just simply too hot, I was sweating heavy while waiting in line to be checked in (also long line at check out since express check out from room TV was not available) and nobody offered us any refreshment or water, also the desk agents did not look very happy to be working in those conditions.	0.2	0.0	0.8	0.0

Had to get a room for a wedding in Hollywood and this property was available in what I knew was a relatively safe location and was at a reasonable price (direct from HI website).	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
Location: First off, Hollywood itself isn't a real nice place to stay - it's sketchy in several areas and not necessarily what many out-of-towners might picture.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

The place was fantastic in every way.Just the right mix between quality service and facilities and not being too over the top.Rooms were large, very modern and had all the latest gadgets installed - 2 Lcd tv's, multi headed shower system, usual Japanese high tech toilets, powerful air-con system, comfortable beds.I have nothing to fault this hotel on.The location was excellent for getting around, the French Kitchen on the 2nd floor did a great competitive breakfast, service was spot on, and the gym and pool facilities on the 5th floor were very well ordered and surprisingly little used on the occasions I visited them.I would definately stay here again.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Let me start by saying	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
I'm a 30 year old guy and I'm not one of these people that have never traveled before and then come straight home to write a review about how wonderful there vacation was, because lets face it, first time in the Carribean, how could it be bad?	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
I've been all over the world, and have stayed in many 5 star resorts.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
The Gran Melia is world class.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
The staff was amazingly helpful, the restaurants were some of the best I've ever been to in my life ANYWHERE!!	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
The rooms were absolutely perfect.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Even the beds were top notch with plush pillow top mattresses, down comforters and large down pillows.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I can't imagine why you would need to go anywhere.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
If you want to rent a car, rent it at the airport, not the resort!	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included ( after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance).	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Taxi fares are not cheap!	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
To get from the resort to the airport was about 30 miles and cost $80 dollars each way, but remember, you're still basically in the United States.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so don't expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Through the resort you can contact a guy named Angel for some of the best scuba diving I have ever done in my life.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
All day tour for about $175 per person, lunch and beer included!	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Great value, great guy!	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort (Don't worry, you don't even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres), and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses (PGA tour 2008-2011) on the property.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
By the way, I read somewhere that the place was overcrowded with locals paying only a small daily fee to get in.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0
Oh yeah, the casino is very nice, and drinks thre are always free (Hold'em tournament every Saturday Night)	1.0	0.6	1.0	1.0

Overall, if cost is a main concern, and you want stay in a basic room for $50 with decent service, in an acceptable neighborhood, then you apparently don't have enough $$$ to stay in a San Francisco hotel, try an upgrade to a local hostel, or stay home.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The shuttle isn't regular enough, and the town of Ubud is fantastic - loads of lovely restaurants, and quiet away from the main streets - I would really recommend staying in the town.	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.0
One absolute positive - the breakfast is fantastic - and free room delivery is well worth it!Overall, I think it just doesn't stack up with other 5 star hotels - the comparison to the Oberoi Seminyak is laughable - now that really is worth it!	0.6	0.8	0.8	0.0

November 26, 2003My husband and I are two of Air Transat Holidays unfortunate clients who spent the week of November 7 to 14 in the Dominican Republic staying at the Occidental Gran Flamenco, Punta Cana.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Thier brochure and website rate this hotel as a four and half star property, but at the time of our visit it did not meet the standard of a three star property.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
At the time of our visit, the buffet, beach club and several restaurants were under renovation.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Our decision on this property was made based on the information in the Air Transat Holidays brochure and the Occidental Gran Flamenco website, neither of which mentioned any renovations.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The renovations to the buffet resulted in the buffet being served in the stage area and theGrill Restaurant.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
There was not enough seating for the number or guests and because the buffet was divided into two sections; it was necessary to go to both lines to obtain a complete meal.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The result was if you ate at the buffet, you had to wait for a table and stand in two lines to obtain your meal.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Not once during our stay were we able to enjoy a hot meal from the buffet.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We had to eat at dirty tables, surrounded by dirty dishes to consume lukewarm or cold meals.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

There was so much demand that all spots available were filled before 9:00am.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
During our stay, we were able to obtain reservations for only two dinners.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

The staff at the restaurant were unapologetic and made no effort satisfy the problem.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We reported this incident immediately to guest services at the hotel, but there was no further response from the hotel.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
It was at this time we tried to contact the Air Transat Holidays representative for Punta Cana, she did not answer at the number we had been given at any time between 7:30 to10:00 pm.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We left a detailed message the following morning but received no response that day and the following day was her day off.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
If we had been able to contact her, we would have requested a change in accommodation.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Since we were not able to do so we remained at the Flamenco, where the next morning a note under our door informed us that more renovations were planned which interfered with the operation of the both the Mexican and the Italian restaurant.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
That made all their restaurants under some degree of renovation with no clear plan on how to provide food services to their guests.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
In addition to the problem with food services at the Flamenco, we had one complete day with no running water in our room and the service at the beach left much to be desired.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Often we were not able to obtain beach towels, some days the wait was an hour, on others days the staff had no idea when more towels were coming.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We had to keep our dirty towels or go without.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The brochure advertises that windsurfing, kayaking, and sailing are included.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
During our stay, despite many requests we were never able to persuade the staff to put a sailboat in the water.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The constant explanation was that it was either too windy or too wavy.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The resorts on either side of us must have completely different weather as their sailboats and kayaks were constantly in the water.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The beach staff at the Flamenco were interested only in selling us the motorized sports that were not included in our package.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
If we had been informed about the renovations at the Gran Flamenco when we were making our reservation, we would have chosen a different property.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
I spoke directly with Air Transat reservations to assist in choosing a property because this was our first visit to the Dominican.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The other services we received from Air Transat for this vacation were exceptional; the staff at the Vancouver airport was helpful and polite.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The flight crew on our flights were wonderful.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
However, what should have been the best part of our vacation the time in Punta Cana fell far short of our expectations, because of the inferior food service and inadequate service at the beach.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
I am sure that our complaint is not the only one they will receive about the problems at the Gran Flamenco, Punta Cana as there were many unsatisfied guests there.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
Neither the staff of the hotel or your representative in Punta Cana showed any interest in resolving any of the problems we encountered; we certainly hope that this is not indicative of your company policy.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
The problems at the hotel resulted in our having a vacation from hell instead of a vacation in paradise.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

My new favorite hotel!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel New York August 4th-6th.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
After much research and reading of reviews on this site, I chose this hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It was our first trip to NYC and this was the ideal location, centrally located to tour the city.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We walked just about everywhere.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It was also very nicely tucked on a side street so it was always very quiet.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The hotel is very clean, beautiful and offers friendly service.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The bed was so comfortable; I could not wait to come back to our room every night just for that!!!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I followed the advice that many people wrote and signed up for a free Sofitel Privileges card and also emailed the hotel to let them know we were there to celebrate our anniversary.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We were upgraded from a queen to king room with a view!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We also received champagne and chocolates our first night.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
With the Sofitel card we also had a 4 PM checkout which was great.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This is definitely my most favorite of all hotels I have stayed in and would absolutely stay here again and any other Sofitel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

The bed was the most comfortable I have stayed on.The only gripe I have about it was that there were no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and being an avid tea drinker and one who takes ages to get ready whilst consuming at least 4 cups doing so, was a disappointment.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ]	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!!	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0
The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.	1.0	0.8	1.0	0.0

I had read much about NYC hotel rooms being on the small side but our room at the Millennium Plaza was very spacious.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4
But the main thing about the room was the views - WOW!	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4

The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4
Like others have already done so I would recommend John's Cafe for breakfast and there is also a great 24 hour deli/store on the corner of 44th and 2nd.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4
My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4
This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.4

The rooms are big and the hotel its self is clean.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

For the next 5 days the resort had a series of rolling blackouts which they would announce with a note under your door everyday.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6

Now on to my main complaint.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
The worst part was, you didn't know what was going to be closed until the day it was closed.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
We didn't get to eat at the Mexican restaurant(which we heard was outstanding) because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
What a major disappointment.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
False advertising aside, I feel as if I didn't get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6
Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners(aka vultures) that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops.	0.8	0.6	0.6	0.6

Orlando, we made the reservations and the staff member(Front Desk) was rude and had no interest whatsoever in me or my reservation there, trying to get information from her was like pulling teeth, but this was my first trip to Miami, and the hotel was downtown so I figured how bad could it be after all the price was right about 100.00 bucks, but I did listen to my instinct and made the reservation for only one night, and booked six nights at the quality Inn at the Falls, the front desk clerk there was great who took my reservation, the River Park when we pulled up looked like a dump in need of some serious renovations, not enough space to pull up to and check in while you take your luggage out of the car, no parking except next door in a office tower (Public ) garage, $21.00 a night, While riding back down in the garage elevator, I noticed a sign that said Hyatt Hotel Guest pay $5.00 a night or something like that, When we checked in at the front dest I asked if they had a similar arrangement with the garage and of course the answer was no.	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2
The Girl at the check in desk had no personality and let it be known by her attitude that she was in control, not the customer, the lobby was O.K. but the room was old and outdated, and not the cleanest room I had ever stayed in, much like the Edison Hotel in NYC, I did not feel safe in this hotel, one of only 2 hotels out of Hundreds I have stayed in that I had that feeling, anyhow to make a long story short, I could not wait for checkout the next day for our 20 minute drive to the Quality Inn hotel at the falls outside of Miami on route one, and just as expected from my initial phone conversation with Stanley at that hotel, It was going to be a great stay there, and it was.	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2
Stay away from this hotel, if you really need to be downtown stay in a well known chain for a few extra bucks, your peace of mind will be worth it.	0.2	0.2	0.2	0.2

The family that runs the hotel is wonderful, and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome (in your language when possible) as well as book you reservations and make recommendations.	0.8	1.0	0.6	1.0
The location is amazing, very near the Duomo (if you are a light sleeper this can be bad for the tolling bells), just around the corner from the Piazza Republica and down the street from the Uffizi museum and square.	0.8	1.0	0.6	1.0
The rooms themselves are comfortable, but a little on the older side.	0.8	1.0	0.6	1.0
They are well maintained though (even if the bathrooms could be helped by a little bleach).	0.8	1.0	0.6	1.0
They offer handicapped accessible rooms which are more spacious and located at the enterior of the hotel (which I would recommend as those staying with rooms facing the streets often complain of the noise).	0.8	1.0	0.6	1.0

A Bit of a Disappointment	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
My teenage daughter and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in early July.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Our room was dark due to subdued lighting and a small window, but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
It was fairly quiet.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The room had a very swampy odour when the air conditioning was turned off.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
We tried to leave our extra card in the outlet slot so the air conditioning would stay on, but it was taken out by the maid and eventually she took it for good.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I had some febreeze so it was bearable.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The decor was nice, different and a bit funky.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The in-room shower was not a problem at all.Our minibar did not work and when I asked at the desk they offered me ice.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I was happy to get it, but a working minibar would have been preferable.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6

The resort was right on the beach lots of palm Trees very tropical, we always had good service at the restaurants; the best and most friendly restaurant was the Mexican.	0.8	1.0	1.0	1.0
The service was very welcoming, the bars were really busy and the wait for drinks took a little longer, but we were not disappointed waiting a few extra minutes for our drinks.	0.8	1.0	1.0	1.0
The staff was very friendly, sometimes they looked overworked and tired, but if you are nice to them and treat them with respect they will give you a smile and serve you well.I read a lot of negative reviews about this resort, but to be very honest as I do a lot of traveling to the Caribbean countries this one was defiantly a decent resort with lots of great activities.	0.8	1.0	1.0	1.0

It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Entry was via a buzzer system operated from the reception area, then a security card key to your suite.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

The reception staff and all the waiting/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Nothing was too much trouble.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
They were also more than happy to store our luggage before and after check out, which was brilliantEverything is right there on the doorstep.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
You cannot go wrong.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldn't hink of anything at all.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area.	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6
It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6
Our room (king bed) was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows.	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6

We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation.	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6
The following day my office tried to call and was told that we weren't staying there.	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6
Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6
The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).	0.6	0.8	1.0	0.6

Inexpensive Boutique-like Hotel	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
If you don't mind a 20 minute train ride to get into the city, this is the place to stay in Amsterdam.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I booked this hotel for less than $100 USD and it is one of the best values that I have ever received from a hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The check-in is amazingly quick and can be done without talking to anyone, if you choose.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The lobby is beautiful.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The room is small (the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed), but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The pod toilet is private enough that you don't feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The TV and the room remote control is awesome.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Now, the only negative about this room...the shower.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Note, the room can only accommodate two people who are close!	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Meaning, don't expect your family of four to be comfortable in one room.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Can't fault it...	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I am lucky enough to travel to Tokyo quite a lot and I always stay at the Okura (South Wing).	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Colleagues ask me why when I can stay at one of the massive chain hotels, also on the approved list.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The answer is pretty simple - you just cannot fault the Okura for price, location and for comfort.A previous reviewer commented on the decor seeming old fashioned.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It's like stepping into my nan's living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It's not true to say that it hasn't been renovated, though.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Over the past few years, major chains such as the Grand Hyatt, Conrad (and most recently) the Ritz Carlton have opened up in Tokyo, but I am a big fan of the Japanese-style service at the Okura - honestly nothing is too much trouble, and the response time is ludicrously fast when you call for help - laundry, iron etc.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo (bath) which you would normally have to pay for.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
In addition, you get two laundry vouchers for complimentary shirt wash and press (really handy) and a drinks voucher, which is perfect for a quick glass of wine before you hit the sack.I have spent many a night in the Highlander Bar which is possibly the tackiest Scottish theme bar in the world, but apparently a favourite of John Lennon and Yoko Ono (The Okura's Presidential Suite was home for the lovely couple during their time in Tokyo, I am told).	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Even if this is an urban myth, I don't care.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I really can't imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope it's true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohama's Chinatown - but it is very good if you're feeling lazy and can't be bothered to venture out of the hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
If you're heading to Tokyo, whether it's business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - it's all good.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

First and formost this hotel is a nice property, how ever the rooms are not at all as they tell on the website.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
I booked a one bedroom (bedroom) being a key word there) Suite....It was not a suite by any defiinition.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
It was a normal sized regular room with a pull down bed with a small divider in the middle of the beds.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
THATS NOT A SUITE....THATS A LOAD OF CRAP.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
I reserved a top floor suite with ocean veiw.....they put me on the first floor over looking a ton of screaming kids.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
The room was supposed to have two TV's.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2

When I called to ask about it, I was told that the was not the case and that the internet website does not have a second tv listed for the one bedroom suite....and low and behold...it does.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
As I was on my first floor balcony smoking a ciggarette to calm my nerves from dealing with this, somone from a top floor decided to spit and hit me in the back on my head and my hand.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
Imagine the anger.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
You book a top floor, you get first floor, you booked a suite, and got a room...you go out to your balcony to relax...and someone from a top floor....(which you reserved) has just spit on the back of your head.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2

I called, and spoke with Matthew Sims once again just to be laughed at and told to have a nice day.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
I decided that Mr. Sims would change his tune when he was confronted with this issue in person, and in front of other guests....I was wrong.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2

I was disgusted and appauled by his actions.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
I was told by Mr. Sims that I should mind my own business to keep things civil I was told that Security would be called, and threatened with police.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
The Police were called to the resort, and just so happens the Manager above Mr. Matthew Sims was standing at the front desk.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
The other manager (Mr. Valdez) was very helpfull and helped me on my way.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2
However.....he charged my debit card a total of $484.	0.2	0.8	0.4	0.2

That was that, thanks!,	0.6	0.8	0.6	0.8
and we were on our way.Later that evening, we arrived at the 'no reservation' restaurant to discover a two hour wait for a table of three and Oh no, we ALWAYS recommend reservations.	0.6	0.8	0.6	0.8

The more frustrating kink was the hotel's dinner reservation system.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
At check in, we were given 2 dinner reservation tickets for reservations in one of the Fiesta resorts' many alla carte restaurants (vs. the large buffets where reservations are not necessary).	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We were told to make the reservation at the Customer Relations desk.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

However, exceedingly frustrating was that the alla carte restaurants were never more than 35 percent full, that we saw, during any dinner time.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
This means that the hotel wasdeliberately limiting the number of available reservations at the more intimate and more labor intensive alla carte restaurants, and in doing so were steering people to the much more cost efficient buffets.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0
We found the lack of available reservations, and the logistics of the reservation system in general (you don't find out if you have a dinner reservation until the afternoon - or evening! -	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

As there were no twins available I had originally booked a standard double in the historic building but was shown to a standard queen room instead.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
The room was beautiful, though small, and everything was neat and clean.	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0

I did however get an extremely strange feeling in the room, and was not keen to stay for a reason that is unknown to me!	0.8	1.0	1.0	0.0
