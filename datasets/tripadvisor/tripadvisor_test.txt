Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip....Book the Beantown Trolley Tour.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0
Buy your tickets at the Wharf, not the concierge - they only have 1-day passes.	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Plaza III is pricey, but well worth the money!	1.0	0.0	1.0	0.0

Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge.	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0

Beautiful Resort but Scuba Diving Not	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
Available - DIVERS READ!	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We just returned from a nice visit to the Copamarina last week.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The grounds are beautiful, room was nice, and overall we had a good time.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
When we checked in on Tuesday we were told that there would not be any diving available until Saturday, the day we were flying back to the US.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
She did not say anything good about the shop, but simply said they do diving.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We would have to drive there or they could call us a cab.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
Therefore we decided not to go diving.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We came there expecting to dive onsite, not have to drive 30 minutes to a dive shop that may or may not be reputable.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The first night we woke up at midnight because the people were talking and when they sneezed at 6:00 am it was so loud I thought someone was in our room.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
I complained and was moved to a room that had a vacant room next door.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
However, during high season this might not be possible.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
The doors are very thin and need some insulation.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
I guess the bottom line is that if you are a diver and plan to dive, I would not stay there.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
Our experience is not isolated if you read the other reviews it happened to another reviewer in March of this year.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6
However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice.	0.8	0.8	0.6	0.6

Positives: gorgeous landscaped grounds in the midst of the paddy fields; beautiful villas; wonderful breakfasts (the home-made bread with home-made jam was delicious); extras such as free mini-bar, free laundry and transfers into town (15-minute drive); lovely spa; fantastic infinity poolNegatives: internet never worked and staff didn't understand why it wasn't acceptable that 50% of websites (including all online newspapers) were blocked by their server; extremely high prices in the restaurant (why should main courses be 2-3 times as expensive as very chic restaurants in Seminyak?);	0.2	0.8	0.8	0.2
the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.	0.2	0.8	0.8	0.2
Ubud itself has a lot to offer, great shopping and sightseeing and restaurants, but does get very over-crowded and in the daytime is simply a massive traffic jam.All in all, the Chedi would be great if you truly need to get away from it all - staying in your villa, lounging by the pool, eating fine meals (at a huge mark-up but probably still cheaper than London or New York).	0.2	0.8	0.8	0.2

Upon arrival at the Marriott, I knew things were not going to be so swell.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
First, there were two uniformed associates outside, a doorman and a bellman.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
While one opened my door, neither of them got my bags out of the cab, nor did they offer a single female assistance into the hotel.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Strike one.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Upon entering, the entire lobby is under construction, so you have to lug your stuff up an escalator to the temporary lobby on the second floor.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Let me explain.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I have no problem with renovations.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I checked and double checked, and called Marriott's Platinum desk and asked them to verify that no mention was made.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
There was nothing.I checked in.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Actually, I was one day early but since the hotel was about 17% occupied, it wasn't a problem.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I was given a room in the river tower with a view of the other tower and pool.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The pools are closed for repair.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Again, I was not informed of this in advance, nor at check-in!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The Concierge lounge, access to which I receive due to my frequency of Marriott-branded use, was across the hotel resulting in a trip down the elevator, across the lobby and back up.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Oh well.A side note about the elevators.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Marriott seems to be adding fancy, high speed elevators to it's large hotels.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The first I saw this was at the Marriott Marquis in NYC.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
You enter your desired floor on the keypad OUTSIDE the elevator.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
So, make sure you pay attention!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The room was small with no view.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The room was very noisy.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I was told that all windows are being replaced with double-paned glass.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Honestly, you can hear people whistling at other people on the street.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Also, construction on the street starts at about 6:30 AM so forget about sleeping in.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Again, I was up early and I don't have a problem with rebuilding.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I took a walk through the hotel.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Frankly, most of the associates didn't acknowledge anyone's presence.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The sole person who convinced me to not leave was one of the security guards.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
She took it upon herself to escort me to the front desk for a room change.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I was informed by several associates and managers that the owners of the hotel (it is my understanding that Marriott owns the people but others own the building) refused to inform guests of the renovations.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
This is inconceivable, especially given that the rate was $30 more per night than at the JW Marriott across the street and that property is completely renovated!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I was upgraded to a two room suite.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Actually a standard room with a connecting door into a parlor room.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The living space was quite nice.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I had two bathrooms, a dining area, couch, wet bar and there is a Murphy bed in the living room so I suppose it would be great for families, or to sell if the place is sold out.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Not likely any time soon.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The food and service in the concierge lounge wasn't great.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
OK, the first night, everything was seafood which I don't eat.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Others may love it.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
There were mini crab cakes, shrimp and a big pot of gumbo.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Problem is, the fishy smell overpowered the lounge, and the elevator landing outside.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Fish shouldn't smell fishy or like garbage.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
It shouldn't really smell at all.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Yuck!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
It looked nice, whatever there was of it.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
However, when I went to get butter balls for my toast, a piece of glass about 1 inch square was commingled with the butter and landed on my toast.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I had to go into the little kitchen to find someone to show.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Her response was, oh Ill take care of it.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Not I'm sorry or some other words of concern, just Oh.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Needless to say, breakfast that day, and each subsequent day was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
YUM!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The restaurant is temporarily located on the 41st floor in what was the fine-dining restaurant pre-Katrina.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
There are a couple sandwiches, some entrees including fish and steak, and appetizers.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
But, dessert-wise, they had cheesecake, chocolate cake and ice cream.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Come on.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I know it's slow, but this is NOLa, can we at least have bread pudding or something yummy?	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The turkey club was good, albeit served just on run-of-the-mill white bread, not the advertised sourdough.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
When I saw that on the bar menu the second night, I asked the bartender.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
She said never in 20 years has it been on sourdough!	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Prices in the restaurant were reasonable for New Orleans.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Typical hotel prices, although room service is around $2.00 per item more than the dining room, plus a 21% service charge and tax.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
That's a little too much if you ask me.Overall, the city is still almost empty which is a shame.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I haven't been here for some 20 years and I don't recall too much.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
The French Quarter is indecent shape but there are a lot of vacant buildings.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Also, while I remember lots of bars, I didn't remember seeing as many of the, hmm, adult-type places as I did this time.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
In conclusion, New Orleans needs support.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
It still can be a charming city again and I am sure that new developments (I saw a big TRUMP banner on the cab ride over) will help.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
y problems weren't with the city.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Most of the people I encountered outside of the hotel were very nice.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
80% of the people IN the hotel couldn't care less about whether guests are there.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
I wanted to shout.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
.I came here to support the city, can you at least PRETEND you are glad I am here??	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
When I went to the desk to hand in my certificate, both the associate and manager told me I had to call in advance and that the certificate (a print out from the Marriott Rewards Platinum page that says PRINT THIS PAGE AND SURRENDER) was no good since it wasn't the certificate.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Frankly I still don't know what they were saying, aside from implying that I am an idiot.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
So, after only 2 nights, I lugged my stuff down the escalator with no help, across the street and checked into the JW a day early.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
We shall see how THAT goes.I won鈥檛 return to the Marriott and I suggest they get their act together and inform people of the renovations.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0
Out of all the associates I encountered, only two-a female security guard and the aforementioned bartender, were nice.	0.4	0.6	0.4	0.0

The resort is gated, no local people live there, they only come there to work.	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0
The whole resort is landscaped like a garden and all felt extremely artificial.I would not recommend eating in the hotel restaurants as they charged at least three times as much as the nearest non-hotel restaurant and the food was no better - in fact the hotel food was bland - dumbed down for tourists fayre.	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0
A simple nasi goreng was charged at 95000 rupiah in the hotel, and around 22000 everywhere else.	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0
It will cost you less to get a taxi all the way over to jimbaran beach and eat there rather than stay in the hotel - and the atmosphere will be better too.If you are looking for lovely surroundings and don't care that you are in Bali then this may be the location for you, but we flew halfway around the world to see Bali and couldn't wait to move on to our next hotel in Ubud.	0.4	0.0	0.6	0.0

We were essentially a 10 second walk from the beach!	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
It was extremely humid so I imagine it's quite difficult for things to dry properly there... hence the mold.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6

I was a little disappointed at the variety of fruit for the most part, but I always found something yummy to try at the buffet.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I also tried the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Brasilian restaurants.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
For meat lovers, I would highly recommend the Brasilian.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Apparently the service can be a bit slow, but we were very well served there.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
You go to a mini buffet first for your side dishes and the servers bring you cuts of meat (shish kabob style) directly to your table.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
My next favorite was the Spanish, which had great selection and atmosphere (note that the drawback to the Brasilian was the LACK of atmosphere - no music, glaring lights).	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Right off the bat, ours got so carried away and the salt shaker smashed into my water glass spraying shards in my sushi.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Something else I laughed off... they just brought me another plate of sushi.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The main course was tasty, but I found the sushi wasn't extremely fresh.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
On to the Italian.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Awful - and like I mentioned, I'm not picky!	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I ordered risotto with mushroom with slivers of parmesan.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I was served a bowl of RICE drowning in a watery cream sauce with parmesan and canned mushrooms.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
If you can't make an italian meal, don't advertise you can!	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
ServiceNo complaints here.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The lobby bar was a bit slow in the evening unless you asked for rum and coke, pina colada or beer.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I tried ordering something from their menu and gave up after repeating my order four times (I was at the bar 10 minutes!).	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
All other spots were great.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Awesome coffee shop you have to try too.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The place also offers massages in little huts by the pool and beach.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I skipped out, but only because we ran out of time.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
PoolsThree on site, but one was closed for repairs at the far end of the resort.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The others were nice and clean... especially liked the one with the pool bar!	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Would I go back?	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Probably not.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
But for $875 taxes in, you can't complain too much.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Some of the people who were travelling with the same supplier were really negative (one even complained about the wind being too loud and needing ear plugs!),	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
so I think when you read these reviews, you have to take into consideration that everyone sees things differently.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The resort was just bought by the Barcelo group and has been branded a four star.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
It is definately not a four star.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Obviously, it'll take more than two months to get to the four star level.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
The place has a lot of potential, so I think that once they actually start renovating the rooms it will be a great place.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
Can one have a good time here and enjoy their stay as the resort is now?	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6
I think so - just keep an open mind and remember that the mentality is very different from what you may be used to.	0.8	0.8	0.8	0.6

Right at the Northern end of this legendary boulevard, access to the Gothic center, the best artisan and designer shopping plus the central produce market, is all within a ten-minute walk The hotel was mostly good.	0.8	1.0	0.8	0.6
We felt that the room was a little small but was kept scupriously clean.	0.8	1.0	0.8	0.6

True, the location is very convenient to the central shopping district and the staff are mostly courteous.	0.6	0.8	0.4	0.4
But, they seem to have only one person on reception and one on bell duty at any given time, including prime check-in/check-out times.	0.6	0.8	0.4	0.4
it is a very noisy hotel -- do NOT get a room in the upper 20s.	0.6	0.8	0.4	0.4
Not only will you hear every flush your neighbor makes but also a tremendous amount of street noise.I have no idea how this hotel secured a 4-star rating.	0.6	0.8	0.4	0.4
Some of the lack of amenities in the $450/night junior suite in which I stayed:No ironing boardNo pants hangersVery few tissues (a small package of 4)A 1x1 bar of soapNo face washclothsOne English channel on TVNo alarm clockNo secured Wi-Fi and have to get new username/pswd each day	0.6	0.8	0.4	0.4

Unusual (and Very Good) Experience	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
I stayed at Hotel Max for 9 days during a conference in early June, and it was an extremely good value.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
For the price, I don't think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young (nearly all under 40 years).	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The rooms are quite small, (although not all the same size for doubles), and the room was clean.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink (I thought it was malfunctioning), but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasn't hip enough to figure it out.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests (internet service in rooms requires an extra fee).	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways (I was sharing a double room with two other people).	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8
Don't miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue.	0.6	1.0	0.8	0.8

One thing you must ask for when checking in is a Majestic Passport.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0
I can't understand why they don't just hand these out to visitors.	1.0	1.0	1.0	0.0

I stayed at the Argonaut for two nights beginning December 16.I arrived very late (after midnight), so I didn't notice the valet parking when I pulled up.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Luckily there was a spot around the corner.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The valet met me at the door, let me in, and was very pleasant.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The desk clerk was equally friendly and I was on my way to my room (482) in a minute or two.Upon entry, I was surprised at how small the room was.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
It was also pretty cold.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Otherwise, it was nicely decorated and cozy.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0

I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The waiter brought eggs and bacon instead.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
When I pointed out the mistake, he returned with sausage, then disappeared.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
I had to flag down the hostess in order to get my check.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
The food was excellent.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
With that sole exception, the service was every bit as good as I've come to expect from the Kimpton brand.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
Thanks to a busy work schedule, I did not get to spend much time in the area around the hotel.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
From what I saw while driving, the neighborhood is very picturesque.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
This would be a great home-base for exploring the Fisherman's Wharf area.A note for the budget-conscious: the parking rates are outrageous - $39/day plus tax (and tip) for valet parking.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
In their defense, it's my understanding that parking in San Francisco is uniformly insane.I would definitely stay here again.	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0
