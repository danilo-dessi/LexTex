The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.	0.3332432520169471	0.24999163524760917	0.3333900570378926	0.083375055697551

My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.	0.33321715974839317	0.24980541093874922	0.3334918200514028	0.08348560926145475
We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.	0.3329845379719928	0.25008402416882747	0.33336556875812046	0.08356586910105945

I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car.	0.33302305946075156	0.24999597255391265	0.333404092988099	0.08357687499723693

We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.	0.3331657432330561	0.2499426249564944	0.33343625423716555	0.08345537757328403

Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival (late, with tired students) we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice.	0.33313447145655417	0.2499476101680628	0.3334528342622673	0.08346508411311586

We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days.	0.33316010034169063	0.24992671782471196	0.33347533063018425	0.08343785120341309
We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.	0.3330901185430534	0.2500109594477342	0.3333478611215516	0.08355106088766062

Positives: gorgeous landscaped grounds in the midst of the paddy fields; beautiful villas; wonderful breakfasts (the home-made bread with home-made jam was delicious); extras such as free mini-bar, free laundry and transfers into town (15-minute drive); lovely spa; fantastic infinity poolNegatives: internet never worked and staff didn't understand why it wasn't acceptable that 50% of websites (including all online newspapers) were blocked by their server; extremely high prices in the restaurant (why should main courses be 2-3 times as expensive as very chic restaurants in Seminyak?);	0.33306993400755236	0.24990700436340685	0.33332662958461234	0.08369643204442831
the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.	0.3332045919224225	0.24990857966716945	0.3335328273955432	0.08335400101486494
Ubud itself has a lot to offer, great shopping and sightseeing and restaurants, but does get very over-crowded and in the daytime is simply a massive traffic jam.All in all, the Chedi would be great if you truly need to get away from it all - staying in your villa, lounging by the pool, eating fine meals (at a huge mark-up but probably still cheaper than London or New York).	0.33344853665054436	0.24975871101319555	0.33344653650501854	0.08334621583124169

The whole resort is landscaped like a garden and all felt extremely artificial.I would not recommend eating in the hotel restaurants as they charged at least three times as much as the nearest non-hotel restaurant and the food was no better - in fact the hotel food was bland - dumbed down for tourists fayre.	0.33316776789344643	0.24984545697543487	0.33346110211005087	0.08352567302106799

It will cost you less to get a taxi all the way over to jimbaran beach and eat there rather than stay in the hotel - and the atmosphere will be better too.If you are looking for lovely surroundings and don't care that you are in Bali then this may be the location for you, but we flew halfway around the world to see Bali and couldn't wait to move on to our next hotel in Ubud.	0.3332762433503179	0.25001735819950305	0.3333309604177994	0.08337543803237955

Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed.	0.33309194108387163	0.24996554429214946	0.3333888781097374	0.08355363651424162

Ours had a walk in shower room- very luxurious for a 4 star and air conditioning- which we did need in Feb as hotel was a bit too hot for us.This hotel is surrounded by great little bars and resturants- stay off Santa Ana for value and is walking distance to all the other major points of interest.	0.3331415452375178	0.24988405423065585	0.33362585141817214	0.08334854911365426
