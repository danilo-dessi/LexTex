A very innovative and fun place to work at........... Very good growth opportunities if you know where to find out about opportunities, Employee-centric policies , Any escalations are taken care of very well.  An employee can get his view across easily.

Googke I think if you are in the right groups in Google and a dev you can work on some very exciting projects that effects billions of people. That's incredibly exciting.  Google takes care of their employees really well and the benefits are amongst the best out there. Our startup was acquired by Google and we were thrown into Checkout/Commerce. The organization within Google had a history of being somewhat dysfunctional and that did not change when we got there.  Our product was sunset which was painful in itself and I was thrown into several me too new products (Offers, Wallet) - This is where Google showed its big company bureaucracy and I never felt like I had ownership of what I was doing.	0.17745391953659131	0.20069985418747313	0.22577157830428962	0.21587089561318415	0.18020375235846192

Inventory Control Expert Employee Benefits. Peer to Peer relationships. Networking Possibilities. High expectations to perform at or above 100% daily with poor tools and plans of execution in a timely manner is unrealistic. The daily communication pool for success is over saturated with ideas. This roll keeps you busy all day, creating reports and filing them. There are many Administrative duties that need to be completed for audit and are constantly interrupted by store sales. Lack of team support creates a struggle to maintain employee moral and ethics.  Microsoft as a Company has many great and solid future proof ideas with poor plans of execution. There is almost no plan or road map to success. Only a number goal and a time line, that create a constant struggle to perform on a daily bases, because of the lack of knowledge of the 'whys' and 'hows' there is high rate of failure. 'The Own It' program adds or often times triples the goal expectations creating an unbalanced depiction of the companies success. I can go on and on about business and employee success strategy failing over and over again. Until Microsoft decides to focus on the importance of WHY their goals exist in the first place, there will be a constant race to "the top" although Microsoft may never know what the top is or how to get there.	0.19026841952804419	0.20011028999400132	0.20865087955230566	0.21973160641556722	0.18123880451008173
Work, Work and have no fun, life Amazon will let you bring your pet to work. The dress code is very casual. The downtown area where headquarters are located is beautiful. This company has grown so fast, it has placed incapable individuals in high and mid level management roles, that makes things very stressful day to day. Managers only care to blame someone to cover their own shortcomings. The work atmosphere is anything but fun it feels like a sweatshop. There are too many managers and very few employees who do the actual work. Most people working there are impulsive, irritated and burnt out from overwork. It is not a family oriented company, work days are very long and stretch into weekends, one person’s work load normally equates to 2-3 people’s worth of workload, if someone complains about workload, they are told that everyone around here works 2-3 people’s worth of work, so go back and work harder. Eventually, everyone burns out and looks for better jobs elsewhere. This causes a constant churn of employees, new people are constantly being brought in and there’s never a stable team. Moreover, there is no recognition of employees. Even after delivering stuff, there is hardly any feeling of achievement because it is not attributed to employees and they are not recognized. Too many layers of managers who do nothing but micro manage their employees and play dirty politics. The annual review process is completely flawed, it favors connected and old timers over the new employee. Pay raises are very low to none, promotions are only given to people who are not qualified but are well connected to the top. This company has such an excellent customer service for outside customers but it has most terrible service for the "inside” employees.	0.1546608416920643	0.22968023846683594	0.17309866994427361	0.239945717280477	0.20261453261634924

Pretty good until if fell off a cliff. Entry level/individual contributors are genuinely good people. High energy, motivated, creative, fun to be around. Absolutely terrible management culture. Non-existent work-life balance. Review system can be arbitrary and capricious. You can work your butt off on a project, deliver it, and get put on a PIP because someone on a partner team didn't like your work style. In the review meeting, your manager might try to present positive data and get told that it doesn't matter.	0.18746702928758952	0.19505525337478954	0.21568364708811416	0.21398870325518313	0.18780536699432362

If only. . . Awesome benefits, so so pay. Good mobility within company. They can not innovate if their life depended on it. Marketing almost always get's their way for more bells and whistles that nobody uses, or wants, at the sacrifice of a quality product. Beware of the infamous, over powerful Microsoft HR. Having managed people I was discusted at the fact that the way Microsoft handles compensation, encourages you giving someone the shaft, and keeping around a sub par performer to be the sacrificial lamb. God forbid you have a great team, because someone will get the shaft so others can actually get raises.	0.17308152893057335	0.23564564754778855	0.20111449688790056	0.23348071516108979	0.1566776114726478

Great place to learn You will learn A LOT working for AWS. The (mostly) unlimited access to AWS resources provides an unmatched learning experience for the ambitious. You are in control of your own progression.  The workload is great for those who are looking for a steady, reliable, boring, thoughtless, easy day-to-day role.  Work-Life balance is generally good. Varies from manager to manager but the good ones let you take care of business without micro-managing your time. You are completely on your own. Most people on your team are entirely absorbed in their own efforts. Unity exists briefly, at best. I don't feel like a unit, more of a cog. You are in control of your own progression, no one cares about you.  Arbitrary time limits ranging from 3-12 months are placed on all kinds of things. For example, when you can promote, when you can switch teams, when you can take on project work instead of mindlessly grinding away in a phone/chat queue.  Mindlessly grinding away calls, chats, and emails. I do not find this work rewarding. There is no continuity in my efforts.	0.19231708718061413	0.20226492752698763	0.21025401477420244	0.21197372247843518	0.18319024803976075

Fun ride, fast pace and changes (including your job) - Good pay The base pay is very attractive. While it ends up being pretty equal to other companies' total comp, it is enticing to get it up front in your base pay. No guessing on how the company will perform. But understand it is iffy as to whether you will make much more beyond your initial offer.  - Interesting challenges They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.  - Growing company with solid successes After being at some tech companies in a downward spiral, it was refreshing to be on the upswing and enjoy the possibilities that come with performing well. - Benefits are weirdly inconsistent Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental  - The culture of fear is real in some groups This is because it depends on your leader. Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same "stunning colleague" standards for non-critical orgs.  - HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great) HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't "connect" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a "generous severance package."  - Your job can change fast, both good and bad Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks. I think people get the high standards communication really well from the culture deck, but the speed with which your personal circumstances will change can be shockingly fast.	0.11599747896264098	0.24308721685108461	0.14615682349292758	0.2859207608269094	0.20883771986643737

MS culture I've been working at MS for little more than 5 years. MS has a good salary and benefit. I would say it's pretty good work & life balance I could manage.

Good benefits, great co-workers, suspect management Worked with a great team of very smart SDEs and SDETs (and other PMs) who worked tirelessly to get the job done. Egos were left at the door and it was truly a team effort. Managers spent too much time creating - you guessed it - PowerPoints for weekly meetings with senior leadership. No time for mentoring. I spent way too much time doing manual configuration work for our project that was necessary but didn't get lot of press (despite my best efforts to communicate it). My org was incredibly top-down, which just doesn't work when you're trying to quickly churn out incremental pieces. Once our major project launched, a lot of us got laid off, even after many spent countless nights and weekends trying to salvage the project. Of course, senior leadership wasn't impacted by the "job eliminations."	0.17113199827025752	0.2139149978378222	0.19184528522305727	0.30188921989409706	0.12121849877476591
Great tech but the non-tech is a distractor Great technology, great benefits, good pay, lots of really smart people While Satya has made a lot of positive changes to the company that are making it relevant again...I feel he is also responsible for negatives like forced diversity and the acceptance of senior leadership being openly politically biased. I worked at Microsoft because I loved the technology, not because of the political views of the senior leadership. Watching keynotes at internal events now sometimes boarding on being at a political rally. It has created a tone that if you are not in step with those views...you may not be in the right place.	0.19157355966343456	0.21787575796298303	0.20635931345213077	0.2297865234899494	0.1544048454315022

University Recruiting - You'll get an incredible amount of hires during peak months - You'll learn an astonishing amount in a short period of time - Most coworkers are intelligent and willing to help - You'll get approached by Facebook, Google, etc for jobs - Transferring teams is pretty easy  I still have a lot of respect for Amazon's University recruiting efforts. They are able to scale quick and hit impressive numbers. It sharpened aged skills and forced me to learn new ones I didn't know I had in me. - Turnover is abysmal, I counted 16 people who left since I joined. No one ever gets terminated or managed out. - Too many fires that are the top priority to put out, impossible to get anything done on a daily basis - Very poor work-life balance, expect to log in from home each night - Epitomizes the Amazon seen in the NYT article - Terrible work culture, lots of people do little more than revel on attacking each other - Horrible management that tolerates and promotes a call-out bro culture - Poor candidate orientation, treated like a burden that needs to be shoveled into an impartial machine  Avoid joining University if at all possible.

Great Product, People and Values Facebook is a great place to work. Its not often that you can say that you work on a product that you genuinely believe in in a company with great values and with the best caliber people. Facebook is such a place. Nobody at Facebook is there accidentally. The interview process is intentionally tough because Facebook would rather have more False Negatives than False Positives (ie they would rather be wrong they give someone a No Hire than be wrong when go ahead a hire someone). What this means is that you are working with some of the best people in the world. Also the values that the company believes in truly important. Its great to work for a place that is so open with its Employees. Since Facebook's product is all about Social, the company makes sure that employees feel free to express their opinions. Everyone is encouraged to weigh in on important decisions. The company structure is such that we dont get fancy titles and therefore we end up being more equal. Move fast is also important, and the company removes all obstacles from employees so that they can do their job well. Overall I love working at Facebook and would recommend it to everyone. Since the company is focused on impact, work life balance could be better. People often feel that putting in an extra hour or two a day will increase their impact. Usually this is correct, but will cause the employee to burn out faster which the company doesnt want.	0.1994973105261252	0.22457617167947677	0.18788407788139536	0.1995999526823045	0.1884424872306981

Software Development Manager In AWS, you will be working on cutting-edge technology with innoviation, The most important thing is you have to work on the scale of AWS, which is the biggest cloud on earth.  You will be totally immersed by the Amazon Leadership Principles. The key to success is always to customer obsession and start from backward.  It is a very fast paced company and you have to embrace changes every couple of months. Once you are used to the pace of Amazon, I believe you can survive any company.  Also, there are many teams and technologies, you can choose what's interesting to you and work on it. If you are looking for stability, Amazon may not be a good choice to you. You have to be dynamic and flexible to work with the technology and organization.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Work from Home opportunities *Training needs to be changed. When I first started training was in depth and I hit the floor knowing what I was doing.

Longtime Employee It's not fair to base the culture of an entire company on the opinions of a few disgruntled employees. I have worked for Amazon for nearly five years and I have never personally seen anyone grossly mistreated, nor have I ever heard of any of my coworkers witnessing such things (and there is no shortage of "water cooler gossip" here). I have had great managers and bad managers, but since rotation is encouraged and people are constantly changing roles, you'll never be stuck with a bad manager for long. If you have a very strong work ethic and have a strong drive, you will thrive with all of the opportunities given to you. When I have changed roles/positions, I utilized my network and literally had my pick of positions, even in roles that I had zero direct experience in. My career at Amazon is in my own hands and I will milk every opportunity and experience I can get from it--positive and negative--and I will learn as much as I can! You have to be willing to work hard and have a strong sense of ownership. If you expect to do the bare minimum, you will not succeed. There will be periods where you may have to put in extra work, such as for a launch or budget cycle, but it shouldn't be a consistent requirement. Even when things are not as busy, it can still feel like there is a lot to do, this is when it is important that your manager can manage expectations from leadership and make time to stop talking about deliverables and discuss employee development.	0.18323102682959563	0.19270887941214362	0.23792023773573992	0.21160446894082005	0.17453538708170077

Fullfillment Associate Potential to learn a great deal about the operations of one of the largest companies in the world. Some great people to work with, although your mileage may vary. Unpaid leave and PTO is too restrictive, does not allow for any unforseen circumstances in life that may prevent you from making it to work (kids, wreck, etc). Extremely fast paced and exhausting work. You will be expected to hold pace and be productive non-stop and you will be held accountable for every second while on the clock. Very limited growth potential. PA and leadership positions within the FC are kept at a minimum, and upper management will stay in their positions forever. In order to climb, transferring locations to other FC's (many times across the country) are more or less a requirement.	0.18885333191074055	0.22368319492765448	0.1967276644181444	0.21172393946109236	0.17901186928236812

Senior Program Manager Lead At Microsoft you really do feel like you have the ability to do just about anything. If you aren't happy with what you are doing at the moment, there are other opportunities throughout the company. The pay, in Japan, is quite a bit higher than similarly spaced Japanese firms. When you are remote, visibility is an issue. This is something that you need to fix on your own as if your boss is not in Japan, they cannot see you and if you aren't seen, it is hard to move and easy to be overlooked. Case in point, Redmond (Windows team) decided in 2014 to lay off all Windows Program Managers who were not in Redmond (a few slipped through the cracks, but the majority went). Didn't matter if you were a high performer, low, or middle of the pack. They gave us a month or two to find a transfer position, or accept their package... to took the latter. This is another negative about the Japan office if you aren't in sales or support, the jobs are few and getting fewer (when I left). If you are willing to move to Redmond, the sky is the limit, but if you want to stay in Japan, sales and marketing may be the way to go.	0.17731250900755263	0.22515937234231698	0.22429710558699661	0.16950170807182513	0.20372930499130876

I've enjoyed my time so far at Amazon The compensation from Amazon is very fair. Vacation and personal time is pretty standard.

Smart, capable engineers - Inexperienced Managers Learning - you will get ample opportunity to learn almost everything, technical and non technical. But you would hardly find anyone except so called "managers" who would like to stay beyond couple of years or anyone who would like to join amazon again. - culture : employees are often recommended to watch and follow "Games of Thrones". One can figure out the intention. - lack of leaders : there are great managers who can "just" meet deadlines, but not good leaders who are humble, experienced, who can inspire you. - poor team structure : you graduate from a top notch university, but your growth here is limited by the fact that your manager is just a couple of years more year experienced than you whose only intention is to meet deadlines and his "promotion" What can one expect to learn from someone who has probably much less "real life experience" than you. there is a concept of mentor over here. but it just for namesake. it doesn't work most of times. your manager should be your leader, your mentor.

A Great Place to Start a Career If you dive into the work at Apple you can expect to be rewarded handsomely with life long skills that are transferable to anything you may want to do. The amount of focus on personal development with both soft and hard skills makes working for the company like being in a major league farm system that will eventually get you recognition to move into almost any field of your choice. What has kept me at the company as long as I have been there is certainly the 401k, ESPP, Health Benefits, and Personal Development. What keeps me wanting to find other employment is the retail schedule and the wages. Coming out of college the wages are probably the best there are out there for someone with little to no experience. Sustaining a family and making it a life long career is just not possible for the majority of people unless they can mange to move their way into management and that is no small feat when you are surrounded by incredibly talented and driven people.	0.1767114838921735	0.24019938721972833	0.2287624085853336	0.24992201213712517	0.1044047081656393

A lot of information to learn at a fast pace.	0.18104877690918417	0.20476562716328717	0.22366884385656405	0.20666243629059333	0.1838543157803712

A place for innovators. Not a place to cruise. You'll work with some of the best, smartest people around. Working at Amazon is invigorating in that sense, rarely do you meet a 'legacy' employee not pulling their weight. Everyone works hard, is engaged, and cares about putting forth a quality product. Big ideas are encouraged. You're at the cutting edge of new technology. Unlike others, I've not seen any issues with work/life balance. Like anywhere, much depends on your manager. The leadership principles keep the culture alive, but even that paradigm can fall by the wayside if your manager chooses to ignore them. It's rare, though.	0.17745391953659131	0.20069985418747313	0.22577157830428962	0.21587089561318415	0.18020375235846192

Nothing better out there Great company to work for and all the pros are true, while a lot of the comms are overstated and come from disgruntled Xooglers. Yes, there are a lot of fish in the tank and you will maybe start a level below where you would start in another company and yes you may do jobs that you feel overqualified for, but ultimately, if you are good, you will succeed.	0.18106309175908333	0.20478181721586522	0.20015806149499385	0.23012817707631783	0.1838688524537398
Great place to work - and can be greater still Flexible employer, some really great people work here, Satya Nadella has brought back excitement and innovation. A company that has changed the world in the past, and has the opportunity to do so again. In the transformation there are still a lot of "old guard" managers about, creating roles for themselves that add no value to the customer, the product, or the process. A carefully placed scalpel could trim some excess fat.	0.1829909824195802	0.2023225430220298	0.1820416998211144	0.22330692312115977	0.20933785161611593
I have been working at Apple retail for four years. The best thing about Apple is their ability to push people to develop. Everything is centered around your development as an employee or as a person. The worst thing about Apple is that it is hard to get hired and even harder to get fired. There have been plenty of people that flew under the radar and should be let go.	0.2544570365207855	0.06766879432750525	0.3383439716375262	0.06766879432750525	0.27186140318667773

Apple is like a family Corporate takes generous care of us and we get to be a part of some of the greatest innovations of our time. Apple hires the best people out there.

The experience was very challenging as the regional management support was unwilling to support. The pay rate is excellent. the time constraints are tight, the margin of error was not there and the ramifications of failure, be it machine issues, management issues, transportation issues were very harsh.

A Fantastic Opportunity to Waste a few years of your life! Fantastic Products, great talent, fast paced... good for young college students. WORK LIFE BALANCE! Expect long shifts, minimal breaks, with pressure from managers to skip or come back early because it is "busy" Not a workable solution for someone with a family! The Vision of the past has been replaced with an acquisition model, poaching big box retail managers from other companies and bringing them in, which has changed the retail store culture from what it once was, to a much more sterile and in your face style. This is a company that outgrew its roots and has transitioned from a one stop shop where you met friendly passionate people who cared about the products to a circus sideshow or efficiency at all costs - even customer service unfortunately.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375

Good place to start a career in safety Great pay and benefits, especially for recent college graduates. You are given a ton of responsibility from day one, which allows you to make a huge impact very early on. Many opportunities to travel across the country to support new buildings. Opportunity for upward growth. Too much favoritism. A lot of promotions are based on being in right place at the right time, rather than true merit. The "customer obsession" mentality works great on the retail side, but it is pushed too much on the operations safety side, where the vast majority of injuries/incidents occur due to grossly negligent employee behavior rather than true management failures.	0.18819987953036135	0.2022688180608953	0.21526826788659603	0.22573989915145531	0.1685231353706919
Happy employees Lots of benefits, great relationships with peers and managers, team feeling. Applying to other positions outside your country of residence is not easy, takes lots of time (you have to apply hundreds of time to the same role internally...) and you need contacts before doing that... sometimes I believe that is easier changing the company than trying to be relocated within Microsoft! Career opportunities depends on the country you are living, in Redmond there are lots of openings, but are not easy to get due to visa issues.	0.18536411330675537	0.2096462597693415	0.204912670107199	0.23984978916353858	0.1602271676531655

Exploitative and mean spirited i) Fast pace ii) Great brand recognition iii) Good pay i) Treat employees poorly. Even non tech business teams are expected to be on conference calls odd hours. I am on 11PM PST call every Wed night for Japan, and 5AM PST every Thursday for India. ii) Hyper political. People submit secret feedback via an online tool. Everybody uses game theory, so essentially its a race to knock people down. In the end, it comes down to your manager's discretion whether to give you a good rating or not. iii) Bad middle management. Once you get to VP level, I find them to be competent and smart, but Sr Managers and Directors are always jockeying for position and climbing on people's backs.	0.20477296132194175	0.18982639224265085	0.21690391855322164	0.24943795800437873	0.13905876987780702

Not Just a new Job, but a new Family. Working for Apple is like an experience none other, heading to work everyday is like hanging w/ the bros yet we always manage to be productive while still having that fun vibe. Apple always treats me like a family member, they MAKE SURE I take my breaks, & they assure I am always treated fairly. I love my managers, they're like my older brothers, always there to listen to me when I have an issue wether job related, or the little decisions like what coffee to get at Starbucks lol. I truly love my job & would hope that everyone in their lifetime at least once works for Apple, it's amazing how some companies say they're fair & that they will take care of you, but really don't. The difference with Apple is that is a lot harder to get a job there you really have to have passion behind what you are doing, & you truly must want to enrich lives, with both yourself, & the product. If you do get the job, you would not have only earned the job, but you've honestly earned a new family as well. Only true downside I can honestly think of & its depending on what store you work at is that it gets SUPER BUSY, at least at my store it does, and I'm always tired after a 9 hour shift, that's about it, not really a con but I it had a "20 word minimum".	0.15154687218501217	0.26605076383485776	0.25118468195067734	0.21135411450211194	0.11986356752734087

After 2 years, can't think of a reason to leave (1) Countless perks that probably adds 20% to your base salary (including free food, transportation, gym, dance/sports classes, etc)  (2) Working with smart/Googley people (you can easily schedule one-to-one meetings with Googlers that are willing to teach a certain topic)  (3) Working for a company that cares about its employees (1) Too many smart people, too much conflict. There is saying in Google, "Welcome to Google, where impossible stuff is easy, and easy stuff is impossible"  (2) The company is now huge so we are seeing less and less collaboration between products.	0.1804414781526276	0.20407877407935734	0.19947089232507462	0.23277124914421882	0.1832376062987215

Great Company Working at Microsoft was a childhood dream, I've been there 11 years and have found it a deeply enriching and rewarding experience. There is no shortage of exceptional people and good teams - there are few average people in the company.  I've worked as a software engineer in Redmond and in Europe. There are many opportunities in Redmond to move around, learn, and have a fun career.  I've enjoyed a competitive package and great working conditions (own office, Aeron chair, sit-stand desk, free drinks, good canteens). For productivity it is hard to beat having your own office.  It is a large company and it fascinating to watch from the inside. Recommend reading Microsoft Secrets, Showstopper, and Gates for sense of history. There is a natural bias to Redmond as the focus for all activities. Most interesting stuff is located there and it's hard to get attention/recognition for work outside. Outside of Redmond, career opportunities in engineering are thin on the ground - people seem to settle into jobs and not move so it feels a little stagnant.  Historically, there has been competition and nastiness between groups. As I reflect on many amazing Microsoft stories, too many involve gratuitous nastiness or non-co-operation rather than building on each other.  There is a One Microsoft initiative that in theory is great and encourages teams to build on each other, but it seems unevenly deployed and you can't tell who is with the program and who isn't. At this stage it seems 50% chance of having a good One Microsoft experience.	0.185970491888072	0.2056168142732834	0.18557194405259536	0.2239250346976126	0.19891571508843658

There is a lot that is great at Apple. Sometimes you have to switch orgs to find it. Awesome company. Awesome compensation and benefits. It's relatively easy to move between orgs once you are in and have put in a few years. You get a chance to work with industry leading engineers. Work life balance can be challenging. Also, not all orgs are staffed with the same level of engineers. Some groups choose not to be innovative and some folks prefer to maintain unchanging routines. If you end up working in a group like this and you want to remain competitive as an engineer you may need to shop around and apply for jobs in other orgs/departments within Apple. Don't be afraid to leave Apple if you can't move orgs. Engineers leave and come back routinely.	0.19041123430959847	0.212524633191421	0.2021839719147616	0.20388507265459402	0.19099508792962486

Perfect place to work at At Microsoft, you get to work on cutting edge technologies and compensation is more than satisfactory. Maintaining a work-life balance is completely possible. Time off is ample and health benefits are among the best ones offered in the industry even with the recent changes due to spiraling costs. What you do can affect literally millions of people and you have the opportunity to bring about change for the better. If you are aiming to become a multimillionaire fast, Microsoft is not the place to work at. (OTOH if you've actually matured into a multi-dimensional person, you realize that you can have a fulfilling life and career at the same time and Microsoft is one of the better places to do that).  The constant second-guessing by the industry wears you down. Work politics can make your life hard but the feeling is that it's going to be much better -- and much more different -- with Satya.	0.1901386142256069	0.1879602159956956	0.24191009780121492	0.23130169821392899	0.1486893737635537

Program Manager - Culture is unique: astonishingly customer focus, performance and results driven, data based to its very core, objective and fast paced, demanding while still being supportive, you feel part of a team, and your teammates are basically all-star level in their fields - Growth: lots of opportunities for lateral and upward moves due to both geographical and organic business growth, there is definitely room for taking responsibility and ownership of your work - Opportunities seem endless with the way Amazon has been investing, who knows what will you be working on in 2,5,10 years? That's exciting. - Benefits: although pay is competitive, Amazon's frugal policy makes a lot of other benefits basically non-existent. Don't expect a barista in your office, or a ton of fun company events. This place is all about "work hard", "have fun" is often missing. - The fast-paced and sometimes hectic nature of a massive business growing at this pace makes the work environment and your priorities often feeling hectic. If you are not comfortable with constant change and if you are not flexible in how, where, and with whom you work - this place is not for you.	0.18588007865634198	0.21022981504215965	0.18985611893486448	0.22527350379978947	0.18876048356684438

High impact, highly hierarchical The great thing about working for Microsoft is that the work you do touches millions of lives and can have high impact. But of course you can never do it alone. You are a part of a team that's a part of a bigger team and so on and so forth and at the end of the day you are just a tiny cog in a huge machine.

Great Working Environment The people who I worked with in Amazon were supportive and willing to help whenever you needed it. There is calm and relaxed environment among employee. There would be occasions where there would be events that employees could take part in events that were organised by the managers. The targets set for employees can sometimes be too challenging to the point where it can lower the morale of employees. 10-hour working shifts are not healthy.

Great company for college hires. I came through the MACH program and it is an excellent program, I really loved the fact that they didn't just throw us to the wolves. It was really surprising how much my class worked as a group or how well we got along. There was also a lot of diversity, I am typically used to having more men than women in a room but it was an even split this time around. Overall, I would most definitely recommend Microsoft to up and coming STEM students. There is a lot of room to learn and the MACH program is amazing, the program administrator is SUPREME I'm not sure I have any cons, I know that there is always room for improvement but I can't think of anything.

They encourage personal responsibility, so you're allowed to work the way you like to work as long as work is getting done.  - All teams appear to be very clear and transparent with regards to strategy. I knew exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it and what the overall objective was. Lots of clear communication and collaboration. You think this would be a no brainer for all companies, but this is increasingly rare so it's great to see Netflix embrace communication.  - Plenty of parking in the Beverly Hills office.  - Catered lunch EVERYDAY. -Lack of new employee onboarding for your particular role. When you're new, everyone is really busy so there is rarely time for you to sit down with someone and learn the processes for your role that are specific to Netflix. A lot of it is learning on the fly and asking questions as they come up. This is fine if you're a fast learner or have a lot of experience for your role, but for others this can be a very difficult roadblock that can affect campaigns early on and stifle rapport building within teams	0.19560292512785415	0.26368460084022066	0.20761871673638244	0.19249477114403352	0.14059898615150931
Amazon Web Services Sales I've been at AWS for about six years all in Sales. In that time I've received promotions, chances to change roles, and it's never been boring. I've kept to working 40 hours per week and use up all my vacation. It's a high growth company and management supports movement across departments. There's an intensity here that I think comes from a high bar from hiring. However, I haven't felt the pressure from the executive team to deviate from the work/life balance I want to protect. The flow of information can be overwhelming. There are so many services and they go so deep. There are often key roles missing because of our high hiring bar and the economics of the job market.	0.1667958458258503	0.21214596293687354	0.1788683357755515	0.251598126987282	0.19059172847444256

Terrible. The pay is pretty decent, a good bit above minimum, especially if you do weekend or night shifts. Everything else. The work life balance is worse than one would expect, given the 4-on/3-off schedule, but the 10 hour shifts can leave you so exhausted that you spend all your time off sleeping and trying to keep up with everyday life. Huge risk of injury, and they're going to make sure that whatever injuries happen are YOUR FAULT so they don't have to pay or give you any time off. Basically no incentive to do much of anything, the best two or three workers in a shift (out of hundreds) might get a free lunch every now and again but a lot of that is down to luck.	0.11841348280892379	0.18080900589373794	0.22955890929039396	0.29090024915325097	0.18031835285369335

Horrible work life balance during the Holidays. Expect to work atleast 55-60 hours through November and December. Very political company with stack ranking type of review. Difficult to find mentors with your best interest in mind. You can get lost in the company if you are not a manager favorite. Depending what building you go to, it can be a nightmare to manage the associates. Most are miserable working for the company and take it out on their manager. Managers are constantly getting in trouble for associates complaining about them, you have to watch your every move. Area Managers do not get offices or any place to put their stuff. They are forced to stand at desks on the operational floor for 12 hours a day.

Dark Truths of Amazon (Funny) - Immediate and Excellent Benefits, Amazon wants you to know you are it's money and you are well taken care of 'health wise' so you can keep working. (Awesome work amazon!)  - If you are a Burger Lad or Dominos Dandy the pay here at Amazon MIXED with the benefits will have you feeling truly like a 'Burger King' instead. ($12.50 starting off and it increases up to 3x at $1 a hour i'm to understand.)  - At higher "Tiers" you make more money, regardless of the type of job you do at Amazon. Amazon is an AMAZING place to be a slacker since if you work 400% efficiency or 100% you get the same benefits AND pay. So the longer you stay at amazon by doing less and keeping your head down, the more Paid time off/money/benefits you get. (Note: I don't answer for the questionable ethics to be learned from this.)  - Pickers at Amazon are subscribed to one of the most incredible work out programs in the world for leg fitness, you'll be exposed to amazoning personalities that regularly endure the rigors of olympian level marathon hustling. They will train you well.  - You will develop 'much' faster hand/eye coordination and reaction time based on Brand/Size/Color/Label, even if you are color blind.  - The workers and 'good PAs/Managers' are often very cool down to earth people with a wide spectrum of life experiences and beliefs, which can be really awesome.  - The Core Ethics and Moral principles of Amazon are profound and inspiring and on every break room wall.  - You get awesome pay during official holidays. (Thanksgiving and Christmas.) Especially if you do overtime. I earned nearly $30 an hour during peak time on holidays with overtime. "Thats" where the gravy is.  - Free Coffee in the Break Rooms. This will aid you in your quest to make it through 10-12 hour shifts. It is dangerous to go alone, drink this!  - People often write hilarious things on the totes. (But management fights this and covers the totes.)  - Some managers can be really funny and cool people.  - SDF8 has Smash Bros. 'and' Guitar Hero in the break room, with all their DLC.  - Supposedly Dogs check the facility for and eradicate 'all' the dust mites. According to our management at SDF8. (Note: We've never seen said dogs, and CERN/DARPA are curious as to these 0-Dust Environments despite warehouse settings, as scientists have yet to achieve this in labs.)  - If you are not an American Citizen you can get away with most anything at Amazon, as long as they can't talk with you. They'll generally not enforce it and "go out of their way" to avoid getting you deported home because 'that is mean'. ... Hurray...?  - Amazon is accepting of culture, almost dangerously so. I masqueraded as a "Jedi Knight" for months in various jedi robes and due to Islamic people rocking Burkas I was unharassed for it and even praised for my dedication to the Jedi Way.  - You will find some of the most ridiculous and hilarious products you have ever seen. Also, you'll know 'everything' society buys and how often.  - If you're on top of your life, your life situation, your bills, and everything is golden in your life. Amazon can be a great place to work, because then $12.50 an hour + benefits and little time/room to grow but plenty of opportunites for random VTO/PTO/UPT is right up your alley!! Because fortunately across the year there's many opportunities for 'free time off', a rare commodity at jobs.  PRO'S Closing: Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes! For the long term? No!! Amazon is the kind of business where I feel Jeff expects the worker to be business savvy/smart and play their cards at "His" table. Jeff/Amazon offers workers help with moving/homes and education and his Health benefits are 'incredible' speaking as someone denied them at most lower end jobs. Come to Amazon expecting to: Capitalize as much as possible on Health benefits/Peak Seasons and then if you're able to get a easier going job the rest of the year until peak areas roll back around. Don't be a Winter Soldier like myself and hustle it the entire year unless you find you love it, and it works for you.  Disclaimer: AMAZON IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, it is a very hard job, but if you're a young hard worker and you don't want to flip patties and you are in a dark place -- I'd definitely throw Jeff and Amazon your way before I would any fast food place. Even with this full report. But i'm sending you towards them honest, don't go expecting a easy ride. - You will likely start as a PICKER, the grunts/backbone of Amazon itself, they walk between 9-12 miles a night (Average rates) to between 12-20 miles a night. On foot. (200-300% rate.) The latter figure of 20 is extremely hard/rare, but we've had some absurd workers in the past.  - Do not bother trying to get Pickers/Packers/Stowers/Throwers/Floor Blowers/Wall spiders/anything more money. Amazons' Management don't see a +250% efficiency for 50% more pay that day as a "Lucrative exchange". Despite the math being there. Amazon as mentioned in the Pro's is fortunately great for slacking, but if you're a hard worker like myself you don't get any true recognition or reward for it.  - Hard workers get promoted less due to being 'Too valuable' in the work horse positions.  - If you work night-shift your only compensation 'most of the year' is a 0.50 cent pay differential with is a minor pittance considering EVERYTHING IS CLOSED during the night, so on your days off (nights) you can't do anything besides Wal-mart and Walgreens. Really this should be more a $2-3 differential, I can't even take a date to a not-tacobell place unless I am staying up to what would be 4:15 AM for most people.  - You will realize you can never afford most of the crazy products you're collecting often times, and especially not the $475 tuxedo for 4 month old babies or $125 "Her Secret" man thong or any of the various crazy products.  - You'll be drug tested up to every four months. I do no drugs so this wasn't an issue beyond it being extremely unethical, a total invasion of peoples' privacy, and frankly none of the companys' business unless I was involved in some form of violation or accident. They also don't drug test management/corporate, cute huh? (Which is generous to say if you know the law, because even 'then' it isn't their business what you do outside of work.)  - No drinks on the floor, even if it's a twist/seal container? You may have water, but chances are you don't want 10-12 hours of Water. Pee-breaks can also get you fired if you forget to take note of them and have proof they were infact for bodily functions and not 'shenanigans'.  - The rate is argued to be 'very hard' for most people, being a ectomorph myself I find it easy to maintain. But my frame/build/muscle tone are all ideal for this job, so that's a rigged standard.  - Not enough time on breaks to really bother with the video games in the one break room, and you may not even be at a area close enough to 'go to that room'.  - Working harder gets you... nothing. Absolutely nothing, you won't get priority for Voluntary Time Off, Increased Raises, Promotions, Shift Changes, Shift Transfers, or anything. You won't even get more voice in meetings and may be stuck listening to old people worry how Amazon might protect them from Rhinos or mad Gunmen rather than work situations and human rights infringements.  - Worst pay in my area for warehouses, despite being owned by the World's Richest Man. (12.50 an hour versus many here being 16+, and YES, it makes it that much worse my boss has so much money that he could make our lives golden.)  - Management has poor Legal Knowledge.    - This leads to many violations you shouldn't have, and high-school bully esque      reactions to workers who would exercise their human rights to say "Sir you      can't do X due to Y law/policy." Sometimes people aren't being sassy, they're      being matter-of-fact and are well within their rights.    - Management has a habit of dishonesty.        - This tends to be in the lower management and corporate seems unaware, but           the effects vary from misquoting rules/laws/policies, to bouncing people           between HR and area heads long enough to get them fired, to stating things           that are impossible like "Amazon has no dust or dust mites because we bring           in dogs."         - This perpetuates a concern/feeling in workers that the managers believe            they're unable to figure out 3rd grade level science facts or basic math in            other instances.  - In Indiana at least, some locations deny electronics up to and including any music and/or phones. This can be problematic if you have to take care of anyone or live in a rough neighborhood where you're "always" an emergency number, or if you have a side job with anything of note and have to be able to be notified if there's some manner of emergency alert. But y'know, you're at 12.50 amazon, you can't risk their important profits with someones' life, right?  - Workers are treated like criminals, and management will even openly admit the intent and reasoning is just that, the managements' reasons at SDF8 in Indiana for metal detectors and air-port level security was "We are concerned workers may be taking photographs or footage of working conditions." with other colorful statements like, "We often have workers steal products from the facility and we wish to minimize that." (Despite metal detectors not helping with clothes their #1 product at said place?)  - You will bottom out in pay increases at Tier 3, it doesn't matter how much you know, don't know, train, or don't train -- your pay will be relatively X at that time and won't raise again. Note, this is technically good too, but capping at roughly 15.50 isn't exactly shooting for the stars.  - Many holidays aren't "considered holidays" at Amazon, despite increased work load and adverse treatment for those days.  - For your birthday round table they'll mostly want free Safety Engineering advice and they'll give you a cookie that has more cheap frosting than one of those Wal-mart cakes. So if you were expecting them to 'really' care about those ideas you spent all year formulating and perfecting, they don't. They want free Safety Engineering Advice or Management Tips so they don't get fired.  - Management can be flawed in human ways, and may have achieved that position through the "Good Ol' Boy" system we don't see much post 2010ish. Normally I wouldn't mention this as a issue, but AMAZON is so computer automated that if you spend even 2-3 months there you will understand when I say "A Robot could be our overlord.", being able to say this i'm content in saying we'd prefer a Robotic Overlord that's neutral and impartial to our feelings and just wants good results than a tyrant that passes prejudicial and personally charged rules that are mentally unsound. It is 2017 and it begs to reason a manager should be able to let a person with 250% Efficiency Rating have music if they want.  - Less pay or Respect than other warehouses. The first, being I make 12.50 an hour is easy to understand, the latter takes a bit more finesse and understanding the job/routine. The stand up's consist of being reminded safety rules you'd expect to be hear preached daily to toddlers not so much grown adults with pearls such as, "Don't drop 90 lbs boxes on your head.", "Don't drink the Purrell from the Bottles.", "Don't fall down the stairs or leap over the 2nd, 3rd, 4th floor balconies.", and one of my favorites "Don't try to ride your push cart down the steps." I understand some one must of done some of these, but you insult people when you bring something it took an oaf to do and ask the majority not to do it.  - They won't give you your full 15 minute break, rather they expect you to only use 15 minutes total. This sounds reasonable until you recall the SDF8 mantra they proudly chant of "WE'RE BIGGER THAN 28 FOOTBALL FIELDS!!!" Yeah, if you're in a corner it can take up to 5-6 minutes at Athletic Power Walking speeds to get there, that's possibly only 4 minutes to sit if you get 'sent back' to that same area. And you might not even know where you get sent, so good luck timing that. (P.S - This can get you fired.)  - Management and HR 'do not' communicate. HR themselves will tell you this. On the surface it sounds unrealistic until we recall this is a several thousand person 24/7 warehouse that never sleeps. It "cant" communicate that well because it's a hulking monster in size. This leads to more head aches for the little guys than it 'ever' could for bosses. Sometimes HR will try to avoid their job and send you to 'your manager' who assuming they're working will 'Send you to HR' who will then ask you to verify with your manager again... And it bears pointing out these people HAVE radios for each other.  - Amazon is by default a Hostile Work Environment legally going by the fact so many Visa Workers CAN NOT COMMUNICATE. Anyone wanting to doubt this? I'll let you guess how many 3/4/5/6/7/8/9/10x lingual people Amazon can or would afford to employ, and now guess how many are on my Night shift. Yeah. that's right, people who speak 3+ languages with some being exotic and rare DONT WORK for places like Amazon just to translate for a $4.50 an hour worker, the nice/professional way to put this is your rights get violated because Amazon wants to save some cash. And believe me, many English workers get fired over "Time off Task" on the chaos/confusion/blockades these immigrants cause.  - Management won't punish the people they can't speak with, and sometimes have no one on any shift to do it and they'll just let it sit until the "Case goes Cold". This isn't accusing racism/discrimination persay so much as saying 'Guys given they're all from X foreign country, this looks REALLY bad that it's only them and a similar group getting exemption.' Again, this isn't saying they're being unfair intentionally -- but expect it to happen, because imagine yourself in the managers' shoes... It's messy.  - Power Hour rewards often are VERY poor, with first place being $10, less than you make in an hour to exhaust yourself. And it's in the form of a vending machine voucher. And they probably forgot you won or announced it a week late and you're getting nothing. Congratulations.   - I was banned from the Discord Global Fitness channel for allegedly impossible feats of strength in terms of my daily walk rates across my time working for Amazon. They accused me of trolling. I am still banned. I did not lie.  - Despite many efforts Amazon realized determination doesn't cure colorblindness, but even so expect them to try with you if you are by sending you to the color coded jewelry section. Where they'll arrive within a few hours to ask why you are incompetent.  - Does not live up to or reinforce fulfillment of it's Core Ethics and Moral Principles.  - Denies most holidays are infact holidays, meaning you don't get holiday pay for them despite it obviously being a national if not global event.  - Has some of the most dangerous step ladders you will ever encounter. This is due to it being so many people using them so often, so much, with little/no maintenance on them so you end up with mal-folding death machines.  - Jeff Bezos is either criminally negligent of the disparity in earnings between his shareholders/owners/workers and his management/self/company or he just doesn't care. This is a problem because men as great/powerful as him need to help the world get better, not make it worse. Jeff doesn't realize he has more than enough money and he just won't pay his workers more.	0.22360258316504095	0.19315967151923177	0.24496575607292348	0.18662047951666208	0.15165150972614155

Stressful environment, but great rewards The pay was competitive for what the job was, and the benefits were excellent even for a temporary employee. The staff, including management, was generally relaxed and friendly. The culture is seemingly relaxed and there is no formal dress code or vacation policy. The environment was very stressful and it felt like anyone could lose their job at any moment. There is a huge emphasis on stats and if an employee does not measure up, they are terminated. The opportunity to move up isn't nearly as within reach as they make it seem.	0.2134924902775708	0.18767149050299906	0.17185368126078898	0.31413520983305754	0.11284712812558355

Part-Time Red Zone to Family Room The transition was pretty painless coming from the Red Zone. If you show interest and perseverance you will surely be able to make the switch quickly. As for how the roll is, I have to say this are much better now. Yes, it is a more stressful environment, but if you treat it very systematic and don't let customer's attitude get to you, then you'll love it. Much less to worry about that sales. For a company that vomits they are not "numbers focused" constantly, they are very numbers (metrics) focus. But they do it in a way that is "under the table". I know it sounds shady, which its not, but near me out. They constantly tell you to focus on customer service and numbers. But whenever you have reviews and/or are looking to move up, numbers will be a huge deciding factor. And let's say you don't get what you applied for, and it was for numbers, they'll say it in a way that sort of seems like it was that, but not really, but yes. This might not make seems, but that's exactly what my experience was. I've been through three different store, 2 different states. All that same everywhere.	0.1574002418555479	0.14941501873682214	0.20615508510730285	0.21951748828695175	0.2675121660133754

Stay two years max, then get out The best part of a Microsoft job is the opportunity to claw your way up within Microsoft. Also, Microsoft still has a long way to coast before it completely runs out of momentum. Shark tank politics, your worth is dependent on your "promotional velocity" (HR's term!), you will always be graded on a curve - the curve just doesn't have a fixed shape anymore.

Google Colleagues, challenges, business prospects, collaboration and innovation are great at Google. The perks and work environment are great too. In certain areas, Google is getting slower and slower, political, process-heavy and quite hierarchical. Nothing compared to most companies, but not as fast as you'd wish. As a result, career progression can be slow.	0.19449347660125507	0.22119656651889372	0.20950459120175594	0.21804711968208365	0.1567582459960116
Mixed. Met some great people, and learned a few things, but the organization doesn't make you better. Some very intelligent people in the product groups, get to work with some innovative products, and the library is wonderful. There is a lot of red tape, and silence on important issues. The training you get is the wrong training, unless you're getting technical training. Redmond is the center of the company, and if you want to do something important, you need to be in Redmond.	0.18255995402587702	0.2064747639789953	0.20181278332005287	0.2237635885187808	0.1853889101562939

Learned a lot, but difficult work environment I meet and worked with some very smart people. And I was able to learn some cutting edge technology. Salary was decent.  Advice for new hires: negotiate as much of a salary, hiring bonus, and stock as you can before accepting an offer. You will not get much for your yearly raise. Dev Managers rule the company. Their decisions will trump other people's feedback. The company promotes those that are technically gifted, but then provides no support to make them good people managers. Raises were small (less than cost of living) no matter how you performed in your review. You will work 60-80 hours a week. Work environment is extremely fast paced and you will have to deal with "fires" daily. Very little work perks or benefits. Amazon knows people don't typically make it four years with the company. So the bulk of your stock payout will occur during years 3 and 4. In the department I was in manager retention was low. It was not uncommon to have multiple managers in a year.	0.19670840816933272	0.20688339505138778	0.19515290603079521	0.21388212171642473	0.18737316903205964

Restrictive, bereft of creativity, too chaotic. Great pay, opportunity to get involved with several projects not directly linked with (or above) the normal duties of your role. Higher management relatively approachable. Good managers will look to help or guide you where required. The rate of change is so frequent that it's hard to keep track of what you're meant to be doing and why. Culture is very rigid, can't be promoted or move sideways without jumping through a ridiculous amount of hoops (if at all). Very process-driven without any room allowed for simplification.

Exploitation at it's finest. No supervision. Pick your hours. Continuosly farther distances to drive(upwards of 40 miles from the delivery hub), and if you end up having to return packages to the delivery hub at the end of your block, forget it, you just worked for free that day.  I used my car for work related purposes only. By the time you get paid, the 18 an hour ends up being closer to minimum wage, and you're using your own vehicle. Amazon has a good scam job going on taking advantage of the less fortunate.  If a customer says you didn't follow there notes(i.e. they tell you to leave it on a side porch and you didn't) Amazon penalizes you by email, and there is no proof the customer is even telling the truth.

Great culture First and foremost there wasn't an actual dress code. ,) The work environment, depending on the team, was really good. Hallway conversations generating ideas, somewhat laid back but still professional, a lot of smart people but not intimidating. The company has changed over the years. It's become like other companies, it doesn't have the same lure or attraction any longer. Stocks are different, admins no longer receive any. The medical/prescription benefits are different. It used to be really great - 100% coverage for many years and then went to high deductibles. Some don't want opinions or input from administrative levels.

Challenging Work, long hours Amazon allows for changing the floor and systems around you. Nothing is sacred as long as safety and quality are not compromised , and the cost is kept cheap.

High paced, challenging, meaningful career as an Area Manager Great pay for entry level manager. Ability to start projects that influence your department/team or facility.

Being a TAM in Fargo is a nightmare Nothing I could think of other than the ability to work from home one day every week, but nowadays most companies adopt this work-life strategy I worked in the Core team for a little over a year and couldn't stay longer. I'm still questioning the benefit of a TAM for businesses unless they are large-scale companies. Core TAMs deal with small accounts, and pretty much 99% of the things they do are remote. You're asked to grow accounts and get surveys filled out while having minimal interaction with your customers. The team of people I worked with wasn't all that great. The manager sucked. Add to that the pain of living in a city like Fargo. MS' cafeteria seems to repeat the same kinds of food over and over. There aren't many career growth options in Fargo, especially if you are in the Core team. If you are lucky, you can get a TAM role outside of ND. If you aren't, you should be looking for opportunities elsewhere. Pay wasn't that great either. Most job responsibilities of a Core TAM are redundant. If you are a customer, you could easily talk to support engineers without looping in your TAM. Other tasks can be easily automated with software.	0.12265557943615935	0.20216490031522838	0.2348040940268582	0.2574520408596697	0.18292338536208438
Overall not bad Microsoft overall is a good place to work at. The pay is good, benefits as well. Offices are well maintained and pleasant. There's a large variety of projects to choose from.

Area Manager The pay here is great for the position. There's a lot of opportunities to learn in different areas here and develop yourself, if you care to do so. Most employees and associates are fairly outgoing and easy to get along with. Here, you are truly in charge of your success of you like the challenge. There's a lot of ambiguity in working here. Working for this company, can be described as a lot of things. You get thrown into the fire of things at times without proper training or understandings. The training here is as poor as it gets. The communication is about as poor as it gets. You will dedicate entire days to your shifts and find yourself with no time to breathe or rest. There's essentially no control over your shift, hours, and it leaves you very lifeless at times. The onboarding process I experienced had to be the worst ever. I sat around for 4 months after being hired to my position before finding out my location and start date. They say they give you 30 days between informal and starting, but that was a lie. They wanted to start me in two weeks. Everything about the culture here is so unorganized and confusing. I recommend this job only if you are interested in working in a warehouse, don't have an outgoing personal life or family to take care of, or want to "own your own development" (which translates to figure things out yourself whenever).

I loved a lot of things about Apple, but at the end of the day it was just another retail job. The people you work with are fun, kooky, and the real beauty behind the work. You learn a lot and are exposed to what retail can be in a luxury style environment. There's no commission for this job and lots of encouragement and resources to expand your customer service skills. There is a LOT of favoritism among managers, and from what I saw it wasn't performance based, but rather how well you could kiss butt. This was just at a store level but I know there was lots of frustrations in management at my store, because of a lack of support for them, so it was a very rocky road for some.	0.13553788070454506	0.24054250256905568	0.15194296592755513	0.19503626955157613	0.276940381247268

Good place for a career Company allows for people to move around to new roles and opportunities to grow their careers beyond one function or industry. Microsoft is large enough that you can be in the games industry for part of your career and the mobile device industry as another part without having to leave the company The company shift functional areas organization has limited the impact a single individual can have on business beyond their core function.

Avoid the Windows division Great work-life balance. The management team doesn't request much to deliver, but expect employees to be reverent to them. A lot of old timers who've just forgotten that they've got to do something in the day. Slackers. Politics and brown-nosing preempt work and delivering. The management team is mostly made of the former Windows Vista managers who're still around. They're so hands-off that the teams are left by themselves. No coherence or control of the little work being done. No opportunity to learn or grow.	0.24456029318727493	0.1762677727959763	0.1936949824666542	0.2794868947342943	0.10599005681580025

Great long term place to work It really depends on which team you end up in, but I got lucky and worked in a team for 7+ years that was really awesome. The engineering culture was top notch and work/life balance was pretty good. Of course when we got closer to shipping, you'd be working a bit more, but for the most part, I never felt pressured to do more work than I was comfortable with.  I believe the pay and benefits are on par with other big tech companies. If you stick around for a while, you get a lot of vacation time. The company is getting better at navigating its future, but it's still a bit lost. You can see attempts are underway to change course, but it's still a bit slow, especially since the company is very reliant on a lot of old software and ways of doing things to pay the bills.	0.18296042785024746	0.20692769868095592	0.18687401577084023	0.23744226795937243	0.1857955897385841

Incredible place to work, changed my life I am in better physical shape than I have been in years. If you work hard and are willing to learn all aspects of the facility, Amazon will work hard for you. Career Choice program- after 1 year of service, Amazon will pay for 95% of tuition and 95% of textbook costs for a degree of certification in industry related fields. (Pretty much anything as long as you stay with the company.) Management listens when you have a concise, though out plan. I recommend this job to any and everyone if they are willing to work hard. Not for the faint of heart. Hard work- if you are willing to stay late and go the distance- the more rewarding your experience will be. It is strictly part time- which kinda bites.

Not the place for good software engineers Microsoft has lots of money and decent benefits. Some of the middle management is OK. If you are coming from a top engineering school, and really know software, this is not the place for you. I felt like after I graduated from MIT that I went back to elementary school when I started working at Microsoft. Most of the software engineers here have no clue and the office politics are out of control, so you spend more time defending turf than coding.	0.24624019376896492	0.16793902966215282	0.18521685019544415	0.2377471263621121	0.162856800011326

Flex scheduling has made Amazon Prime Now a terrible place to work Fair hourly wage, the work activity can be really good for weight loss. The Flex shift hours can allow one to feel like they have a good work life balance, especially if you don't mind missing a few paychecks. The break room is nice. They have a microwave and vending machines,and water coolers. There are not many pros in the current configuration of Amazon Prime Now Flex. The workload has increased substantially and the manpower has been effectively reduced through the misuse of the flexible scheduling option. Some employees scramble to be online so they can snatch availability at the location I am associated with, some of them go for weeks with no hours available to work. I was shocked to see how insidious the lure of a change in status of employment from part time seasonal to a permanent Amazon hire was used to basically trick the unsuspecting employee into reducing hours for the company. Since the change, I see understaffing to the point that the managers have to pick product and the associate that has hours has to work at a fever pitch just to keep up with the demand.When the service launched there were,on average, eight employees on shift. Now there may be two and in some cases one. That is very abusive. One more thing. The managers do not care that you have been picking product from the time you clock in. Once you finish the task of picking and slamming products the expectation is that because they are so short staffed and need to have product put away or stowed they continue the grind you into the dirt...until your break, which you will need because the warehouse is so hot you drip sweat.	0.17500807235922405	0.2517652334401395	0.19172848612709975	0.2626945853082658	0.11880362276527096
MSGD-MGSI not a Microsoft culture, its like any average service company. Microsoft Corp Policy benefits like Insurance and Health Benefits, Work from Home, Cab and Bus services, Decent T, coffee pantry areas. 1) Microsoft is driven by stock levels, i.e. 55,56,57, and so on. MSGD is treated as lowest stock levels it used to start at 55 but now it starts as 56, all other companies under Microsoft like IDC, MSIT starts from 58 or 59. So overall you are valued lower at MSGD. How it will impact you->You will not get stocks of Microsoft in your package. also it will be problem if you want to switch to other groups like MSIT or product Team.  2) Work Life balance is totally screwed here. As Microsoft their billing rates are very very high so to get projects they estimate very less so eventually dev team has to face that consequences and work day and night to complete project on time  3) All projects are driven by consultants here, there are project managers are there who works like assembly line supervisors and try to put every thing on dev leads and test leads. So if you are going to join as lead position then beware or project managers here. They are the reason why lot of people are leaving this organization. 4) You do not feel like "EMPLOYEE" working in MSGD you are just another RESOURCE.  5) On-site is very limited in most of the service lines. only one of the service line which is having high onsite. That service line is related to infra. So if your aspiration is for long term onsite then do not Join MSGD.  These all are true feedback not from any frustration or anything else. i can challenge anyone if any one say this is not correct.	0.1603958795309128	0.2036778779095383	0.210078623804799	0.2415552569625502	0.18429236179219968

I just went somewhere else and work only 50 hours a week and get paid the same, more importantly I am valued more as a employee.	0.2095764280417707	0.23428631257071328	0.1659872991887916	0.2395068484729291	0.15064311172579534

Decent Job Repetitive Work Can move up if you become a disciple of Amazon. Monthly bonus as long as you show up for work without using unpaid time which is basically no call no shows that Amazon pardons. I work in AFE which sorts and packs the products so I can say my area is more enjoyable then others. I wish this job was around (our site is less then a year old) when I graduated High School as Amazon pays up to 95% of a $3000 yearly allowance for school and books for four years after you have worked there for one year. For peak (Christmas season) they give out gift cards, tvs, and xboxs etc even though I didnt recieve anything its cool that they did that, but you get alot of Overtime in peak so you miss that check in the later of the year. Work is boring and repetitive as others have said, repeating a task done in 5-15 seconds nonstop over the course of 10 to 11(peak) hours. The only way to move up is to be extremely fast at these tasks and kiss managers but who by the way are grossly overpaid must of the time they just stand around monitoring your numbers and come ask "are you feeling ok" if your numbers dip, I get they have there stresses but for how much Amazon pays them I feel they can do alot more, as it seems if you have a problem and ask them or HR they are clueless and need constant reminders and effort on your part to achieve simple tasks. Seniority doesn't mean anything as soon as someone faster comes along they are the new "big cheese" , its always funny having some new person pretend they are the new coming of God when they are completely lost themselves. Pay moves up .25 cents every 6 months for 3 years which kinda blows when you bust your but and know you cant get a pay raise unless you move up in Amazons ranks.	0.18861300086545202	0.16293383008252876	0.2372977241657659	0.28311616360413	0.12803928128212336

Think before you jump in Fast paced company, lots of change helps keep things exciting, freedom to create and work on projects you come up with yourself. Although it is a US company, in Japan it is a Japanese company with Japanese style management. Be prepared. No work life balance, people who try to have a life outside of work are looked down on. Despite the abundance of growth, Senior Management is hesitant to let the subject matter experts be a part of the decision making, driving poor decision making. Compensation plan is set for your pay to drop after 2 years (many people quit at this point) Hard to make a real impact. Poor decisions being made by management are masked by the companies growth. Although everyone works very hard, they do not work smart (time in the office = effort, good ideas do not matter.	0.11767290939053271	0.179678202708203	0.265722486776821	0.24533076660396114	0.1915956345204822

I guess it could be worse? PTO, vacation time, health insurance, 401k, organized workplace, clean warehouse There's a tremendous amount of "shady" business. Upper management is very condescending. You are not genuinely cared about as an employee, you are more so just another number. The equipment provided for you to do your job is constantly breaking down, but if you don't hit your numbers you WILL be fired. Because of this, many employees need to push themselves extra hard in order to hit their numbers when the equipment IS working, which tends to be physically tiring. Equipment is down 30%-90% of every day. We are told that if we can't hit our rates because of the equipment, we will not be written up for it: this is a complete lie. There is also a considerable amount of favoritism towards the people that kiss up to management, so they get to goof off while everyone else is working as hard and as fast as they can.	0.22497214438947083	0.21355886606619617	0.08896905436582452	0.31375631631004	0.1587436188684687
Part time Product Adviser The culture of Microsoft is among the best to work for. Their mentality of helping customers is that they don't want them to just come in and buy. They want them to have FUN, be ENGAGED, and have a great experience in order to achieve more. I bet there are not many places you can name that offer personal training sessions, out of box experiences when you buy a device, gaming tournaments, community events and so much more. Uniform honestly looks fresh compared to other companies and the experience with customers is unlike any other retailer. There really aren't anyway. If you have open availability the only thing is you'll be working a 9 hour shift with 1 hour break.

Worst place to work for 1. Free Banana 2. Good initial compensation 3. Very easy to get hired. You may impress bar-raiser by solving FooBar, and can get hired. Sometime they even hire you by just a single hackerrank round. 4. It's good only if you have plan to leave within a year. 1. Very easy to get fired. 2. Bad promotion process. Lucky ones get promotion within a year, unlucky ones get 4+ years 3. 0-5% increment. Almost discouraging for you. 4. Leadership leaves team very frequently, and so SDEs effort get waisted. 5. You will always hear that this is VP level project, you work 7-8 months on the project, and suddenly project gets de-prioritized. 6. Worst hiring practices followed. Leaders don't know how to hire people, they always compromise quality to accomplish their goal and latter fire. 7. I would say, it's kind of ego issue with Amazon. they have completely forgotten their value and now not innovating anything rather than just doing useless thing to remain in the market. 8. Amazon will disappear in the coming decade, so not good for long term.	0.22099695901346256	0.2097853496443872	0.1158960214912338	0.26487188900400255	0.18844978084691394

Definitely not boring Makes you think in large scale/global Data driven Customer focus Alpha White Male dominated Needs lot of sucking up to old boy/men network - if your thinking is different from the norm (esp. of sr. anager or above), you will be beaten down hard. Getting to be very bureaucratic. Teams have their own goals/agendas, and don't want to work across the aisle. You are held accountable for failures without being given adequate power/authority to effect change. Managers are focused on getting themselves to the next level, and pay zero attention to developing employees. I had three managers in one year, and none of them held 1-1's unless i insisted, and even then it was around project status rather than development.	0.19386409676879418	0.21925971573516115	0.19801091800366788	0.2212907882145542	0.1675744812778227

Overall good job You get Great benefits (Kaiser) , decent pay and a lot of opportunity for getting a raise of your doing your work correctly, plenty of overtime. Set schedule little room for change. For example a schedule may be SAT-THURS 6pm to 4pm. That would be your permanent schedule.

Such a great place to work The culture here is fantastic, there are so many things that just work well together. For example, most engineers choose which team to join after the first 6 weeks or so, which encourages a lot of really positive behaviours. The company is also really open, allowing everyone to make great decisions: if you need access to some data, you probably have it available.  We have good tools and infrastructure that allows us to focus on the important things, things like booking a meeting room, following up on a task in a common system and many other things are just easy, using great tools that an internal team builds and maintains. I also think that the engineering-led approach to product development and a willingness to try things is really special, and allows us to be more bold than most other companies.  Oh, and the free food! Breakfast, lunch and dinner, with lots of great options, both healthy and not-so-healthy. It's not a great place if you value being in charge, or being told specifically what to do when. Everyone is expected to be self-led to a large extent.  There also is relatively little documentation. If you want to find out something, most often you need to ask someone rather than read a document.	0.1897428791675103	0.20418536279425284	0.20438734001825587	0.21272121310002987	0.18896320491995117

Unorganized and not fair Pays decent for the job requirements. Short shifts that work for most ppl with full-time jobs. Easy to get hired. VERY lazy employees.

Come to learn, but don't stay too long It's like they say about New York City, you should live there while your young so you can experience all it has to offer, but don't stay too long because it will grind you into dust. The deliver-at-all-costs machine flings bodies left and right. There's a reason the average length of employment is 18 months.  Pros * Some smart people to learn from * Fast moving culture * Opportunity to learn quite a few things as long as you don't linger too long educating yourself Focus is solely on delivery. They have a set of core competencies, but don't be fooled. The only one that really matters is "deliver results." The rest can and will be used against you in the review cycle. You can be a rock star in all others but if they don't like your delivery they will do what they can to make you feel inadequate about it.	0.16696661531662535	0.15849607130116383	0.24983609383839792	0.23285918490338967	0.19184203464042335

Whether your a manager or individual contributor you have to take ownership of your own work and deal with ambiguity at times - this can make it difficult during those first few months of employment while you're still figuring things out.

Microsoft is a mixed bag, there are a lot of opportunities and pitfalls. I love working with passionate and smart people, who are driven to deliver really good products that customers will love. I love the benefits and perks, which are stock, cash bonuses, prime discounts all over the place, gorgeous campus etc. Flexi time is one of my favourites, no one cares when you are in the office as long as you can deliver. The company is very large and changing rapidly now, one of the tough things is they are bad at choosing managers. A lot of my friends have moronic/incapable managers who are ruining talented devs. Also there are a lot of silos of knowledge, however this is decreasing a lot more now.	0.183439228706348	0.16859562986625862	0.24933269229390748	0.2301987358385269	0.16843371329495893

Amazing for some, horrible for others Great place for career development as well as great leadership. Your management will always have an open ear for you and listen to your ideas as well as personal career plans. The rate at which the company is expanding and launching new products. This simply puts so much pressure on the employees that some work constantly overtime. Sadly the rate of newly hires people can't cope with this which leads to even more constant pressure. A lot of 'old' employees left the company due to this fact. Other than that the benefits could be better: Employees pay to use the car park and also other companies do offer much better benefits in various areas.	0.15045243969028327	0.2450287381208996	0.18408935490668932	0.29373267596399466	0.12669679131813325

Engineer, Infra team Menlo Park, CA I've worked in half a dozen companies in my career and this is definitely one of the top two. I suspect I will rate FB #1 by next year. The work is intellectually challenging, the environment is fast-paced, and the people I work with are excellent. FB has its eye on the ball at all times for its core platform yet is always looking at other opportunities for growth, though they may take several years to bear fruit. Management is open and accessible, particularly the weekly Q&A's with MZ and the leadership team - I've never experienced senior executives sharing that much information with an entire company before. Colleagues are easy to work with - not a lot of ego or politics that I've seen. In fact, we are reminded to check our ego as we enter the building - there is a lot of cooperation here. The benefits & perks are really amazing - I don't think college hires or interns truly appreciate what is offered here unless they have worked for other employers. (You can never take these things for granted, so I really appreciate these perks.) And the total compensation structure seems very competitive - they have many dials and buttons to play with, and I feel I am well-compensated for my contributions. The commute benefits are excellent, and make it really easy to use transit, shuttles or vanpools. Driving to work is just so stressful, both ways. I'd really rather not. Long hours away from home, due to my own commute situation and long working hours. But since I've only been here less than a year, it's important to show results early. The learning curve is steep and the bar is set very high, so it will be easy to separate the productive from the not-very-productive in a short timeline.	0.17122513067779294	0.2695534133964111	0.216265885286718	0.21413666391419645	0.1288189067248816

Worth The Experience Alone Apple being one of the most recognised and successful companies in the world means they are not short of a penny or two, and it shows. Their benefits are some of, if not the best in retail, from the standard Healthcare, free annual checkups, optical and dental coverage, seasonal ticket loan to partner benefits companies who offer lifestyle discounts (Perkz) to more luxury benefits like support for study in a course relevant to your position in the company.  You are very very well looked after and for product launches, peak trading season (Christmas) and other events the £ spent per head on employees for lunches and buffets is unheard of. Expenses are not spared, but you are expected to deliver. Then there's the discounts on products which always come in handy to soften the blow of the premium price tag of the latest tech. The biggest challenge is that there are so many talented people working at Apple, for management there simply aren't enough opportunities to progress. This leads to people doing whatever it takes to 'one up' and tread on each other to be seen as the best in the hope they'll create the right impression to get ahead. Unless you want to be a Store Manager there literally is a glass ceiling beyond which it is difficult to progress. You'd think working at the company would put you in a prime position to be at the front of the queue to work at head office - unfortunately - this is a misconception. Head office and Apple Corp prefer to source external candidates.  If you're happy to continue working and receiving great benefits and pay but are prepared to put in a lot over the years but not necessarily progress that quickly and are realistic about the prospects then this job would be suitable for you. If not, make the most of the experience and make your mark before moving on - working at Apple is a very well desired personal brand attribute in the job market.	0.1876242252307176	0.2390137873299122	0.18083599057284525	0.22943856030734655	0.1630874365591785

Worst culture ever Pays well. A global brand to work for. Amazing communication of the principles and values across organisation A pathetic start to the culture in India especially in the fulfillment center ops area. Management lacks back bone and is scary. Infact there are a lot of common features mentioned in the New York times (NYT) article which resembles the work culture at Amazon. The major cons incl eg. 1. absolutely no work life balance (even if u die working there will hardly be any sentiments around). 2. Lack of empathy. 3. Health issues due to work culture. 4. Pathetic management 5. lack of actions taken by HR and managers on issues being reported 6. A very local Indian version of a global company which u would definitely NOT want to get in,where every person thinks he can rule the org. himself. 7. Though rotations across locations is suppose to be common (thats what the HR claims), its almost impossible to move out of this org due to its bad management Even if u desperately want an operations stint , ABSOLUTELY not recommended for people who want to get into fulfillment centre operations here. U will regret being there. Do go through the NYT article on Amazon's work culture, if still in doubt. Its nothing different in India, infact its worse. I am personally NOT recommending this company to any close friend of mine unless u want revenge with any of your mates.	0.24957830373324072	0.21026640881078276	0.23189893391778654	0.21978992554572482	0.08846642799246526

Warehouse Work Day 1 benifits. 4 day work week. Paid time off. Unpaid time off. Vacation time. Overtime pay and holiday pay. The pay is just okay, with raises every 6 months. Shift differential if you work night shift. Give aways during peak season. Long hours 10-11 hour shifts. Don't really get to pick your schedule, just depends on their need and you can't change until you have spent 90 days in your department. Stand on feet all day, not sitting at amazon. Concrete warehouse gets hot in the summer in FL. Not much room for advancement if any. Breaks are short and lunch is only 30 min. With 3-5000 employees there is no hot food, just microwaves. And if you choose to try a fast food place by the time you get out of the building, get to your car, drive to a place, you have to eat on your way back, park and walk in before you are late. Parking lot is huge and always packed. Peak season the parking lot is a mess when all 3-5k employees get out at the same time. Simple repetitive work all day with no music or people to talk to. Definitely all about productivity.	0.2228618828109911	0.23438969067246235	0.07309076629082677	0.2573721884079621	0.2122854718177579

When you get on full-time, the benefits are pretty killer, and usually the scheduling is pretty accommodating if you need a sudden day off but don't want to burn a vacation day or sick day.

The love to promote from within, but they pretty much peg these people from the beginning of their time with the company, and if you decide after a while you want to do something else in-store or move up, it can be a little hard to convince people you are more than just one-note.	0.1690730040257192	0.16049559877790764	0.16823540755302843	0.25462295572868365	0.24757303391466123

Hardware Design Engineer You get to work on very cool products and learn a lot while doing it. If you work on the hardware side you work with very smart and motivated people. In fact, most HW engineers are among the best in their areas of expertise. As a hardware engineer you travel a lot (not a 'Pro' for me, but some people like traveling). They fly you business class if you cross an ocean, and you can stay in very nice hotels. If you need a tool for your job and you can justify it then the cost is not a concern, so you get to work with very cutting edge tools. The hours can be long and lots of travel (more than I'd like). They've been penny pinching over the past few years in terms of benefits and travel expenses (travel policies get stricter/cheaper each year). It can be surprisingly difficult to order Apple equipment for internal use. Most people seem to burn out after a few years, surprisingly few engineers have been at the company for more than 5 years.	0.1814130681733199	0.23110141796415462	0.20682630326928694	0.22184317153844027	0.1588160390547983

You'll enjoy it (if you're up for the challenge). You will learn and grow at twice the pace compare to other companies. Plenty of training opportunities. Best engineers in the world. Very engaged and hard-working workforce. Amazon's 'Leadership Principles' make sense, are used every day, and are what makes the company tick. Hard to achieve work-life balance.

HR Leadership Good opportunity in HR for those that do not have prior HR experience, especially if you willingly and without question drink the koolaid.

Horrible culture in the traditional non-sort facilities (I can’t speak for the other building types).

Take the bad with the good Better than average benefits and great pay. If you can last in the fast paced environment, overloaded with work, n-1 staffing approach etc. you can thrive at this company. My advice is to work there for a few years then move on to a company that will really value you. Management environment is poor at best. High level management is not held to the same standard as mid-level and junior level management. Political environment is rampant here. They do not staff to the level of demand so you will find yourself overloaded most of the time. Results don't truly matter at the end of the day, it's whether you can play the political game and never provide a true view of reality that will allow you to advance quicker than your peers. There is a lot of emphasis to get to the top 5% and stay there by managing your political resume versus your true work resume.	0.22575550018985266	0.21783108289923822	0.17510706352567335	0.20910446467929217	0.17220188870594366

More cons than pros Remote, Opportunities for both VTO and Overtime, easily chat with coworkers, managers, Leads (unless it was heavy volume) Training was extremely lacking - We actually skipped several lessons altogether. No pay increase for "promotion". They always seem one step behind - unprepared. The system used could definitely be simplified. When Xferring/escalating a customer we were often turned away (which is against the rules), and/or greeted with attitude. Tip - When transferring your customer if the associate tries to reject the call say, " So you are refusing to take this call?" Being forced into admitting that they are doing something they are not supposed to do usually makes them change their tune.	0.24066601656270847	0.2533326490133773	0.11551212578147295	0.15826761371351203	0.23222159492892921

Once an Amazonian Always an Amazonian! Surrounded by intelligent people, pushed to your limits to bring out the best out of an employee. Every day you get to learn something new. The best part is that each and every employee works towards making Amazon a better platform and to make it easy to use and to make the customer's life easy. Though there are plenty of opportunities to grow, the promotions are all dependent on the managers politics. Promotions have nothing to do with talent or hard wok, but internal politics- which is sad. This the only reason why employees look for opportunities outside of the company and they consider moving out of the organization.	0.18643783596683375	0.23750245055631738	0.23676718160539761	0.2409833703402556	0.09830916153119565
You get what you put in As a software engineer in Amazon, you will get to work on top-notch projects. The difference between Amazon and companies like Google, Facebook is that in Amazon hires "average" engineers to do "elite" work. So, there are a lot of opportunities for "average" engineers like me. If you get bored in one team, you can easily move to another team. There are so many teams to choose from. If you have an idea and want to work on it, you can easily prototype it and pitch to senior management. If you work in a team which has clients all over the world, sometimes you have to take late night calls. If you work in a team which has oncall, it might take a toll on your work life balance. Amazon has a "sink or swim" culture. A lot of people might not like it. One of the growing pains in amazon is high density seating.	0.18238832165415667	0.18977097161057588	0.2098405172906466	0.23528269605974406	0.18271749338487675

Great place to work - Exciting environment as the market rapidly changes/evolves but Microsoft has been keeping up with it under the new CEO's management, part of which is represented by revenue growth and stock price increases. - Very mature org with history, where management process is established. On the other hand, we adapt to the external changes flexibly at the same time. - great people to collaborate with - flexible work style - good salary Maybe volatile in consumer business, such as Surface, as the past cash cow of Office gradually loses its profitability.

Easy job, but *very* little formal training Little responsibility, good pay, good exercise. The job itself is very low stress, and high energy. I enjoyed it, overall. Very little accountability. If somebody on your shift does something wrong, everybody has to hear about it. I had about 5 people above me on each shift, and communication was lacking. One supervisor would tell you to do something, and somebody would come a long to tell you it needs to be done a different way. Seasonal associates get very close to ZERO formal training. You would literally get thrown into jobs having no idea what to do with a 5 minute crash course on procedure.

Overall great place to work Great benefit and great pay, if you want top pay for your level of work, this is definitely the place. Challenging work, smart people, team oriented culture, flexible work hours, and overall friendly work environment. It's very easy to get into "great engineers don't always make great managers" situation, often IC got assign/promote to management role, not at will but as "expectation" of his/her level, generally result in team under-managed or worse.  The company promotes team oriented culture and "no rock star" approach, but the review process speaks otherwise.  Flexible work hours can be double edge sword, you should not expect every week is exactly 40 work hours. (Although managers are generally cool with taking "rain checks", so you can work a 60 hr week, then skip Friday for next 3 weeks.)	0.23386408807489883	0.2194596090418054	0.2031901851277316	0.1986493047812631	0.1448368129743011

Long hours, depending on the group in which you end up, you may find people between the Apple cultist to the cool and easy-going engineer.  In the late years, that spark related to doing something new, got wet due to a more cautious approach to products. There is still a lot of innovation, but the risk taking attitude changed into focusing on something that will sell well first of all.

I left as it was so terrible none what so ever your a cog in a money making scheme with no chance of promotion, benefits, or anything i can think off I worked for apple for some time, i could not recommend it to anyone, everyone works on a 16 hour contract so they can stop you from getting a pay rise or holidays or health cover, would end up going in for 2 hour shifts loosing money due to travel costs, and its like a brain washing machine, how can someone advise you on tech products when all the other staff use is an iphones, i use mac windows android you name it, i think it makes no sense to say you can only use one or the other ? Also the managers are not tech trained and could not organize a shift pattern if they tried, apple is like a religion for some, they do try and brain wash you its sad because some people just cant see it happening to them its like hitler youth? plus the wage is terrible imagine working all hours screaming customers, massive ques of people all for minimum wage ? if i had to choose between mcdonalds and apple id pick mcdonalds.	0.19568437783586465	0.16904245742242577	0.17131961206205457	0.33111389167390654	0.1328396610057484

Best team, best company, best culture The culture, the energy, the teamwork. I've worked for many companies over my 20 year career. They all have buzz-word laden catch phrases to which they just pay lip service until the profit motive overrides them. MS is different. You feel it genuinely practices what it preaches because it realises that sacrificing some pennies today to do the right thing pays dividends over the long term. And it all comes from the very top - this is how you do leadership by example.

Terrible Decent benefits & lots of mandatory overtime means extra money They push you to meet barely attainable goals hour after hour, day after day. It's all about numbers for them. The physical rigors of meeting these demands leads to pain all over your body. Several of my coworkers had carpal tunnel surgery in an attempt to keep up. If you complain, management tells you to take 5min & grab some of the free tylenol packets they have all around in dispensers.

It gets old I love this company. The teams are great and I had great leadership in the time I have been with Apple. We have amazing medical, Dental and vision as well as a lot of other amazing benefits that I can't really go into. There is very little room for advancement into leadership. Internal movement upward is virtually unrealistic. At-Home-Advisors have schedules for 90 days and then you bid. This makes it impossible to plan your life beyond 90days. Also the customer base is 50% self entitled clowns that feel it is ok to belittle you and yell at you for trying to help or that think Apple has a responsibility to solve 100% of their issues and you have to be the perfect ( )( ) kisser so that you don't get a bad review. They also overlook people with high levels of experience and higher education.

Great opportunities for programmers and business people -- not great for business intelligence engineers or analysts There are many exciting opportunities at Amazon, and it is possible to make a career at Amazon through a combination of lateral and upward moves. I have been on 3 teams in under two years, and the flexibility to transfer has allowed me to get a good sense of the general challenges, expectations, and best practices for someone in my role in a way that I could not if I had spent the whole time with one team.  Amazon is truly customer obsessed, and for anyone who is interested in how the business runs and how Amazon is able to maintain such high approval ratings from its customers, it is a fascinating place to work.  Amazon has a lot of data, and learning how a company of this size stores, retrieves, analyzes, and safeguards its data is a great preparation for wherever else you might work as a business intelligence professional / data scientist. You have the opportunity to get a lot of analysis experience here.  You will get the opportunity to work with AWS. A lot. The required skills for the business intelligence roles at Amazon have been, until recently, poorly differentiated. As a result, the skill sets of adjacent roles (e.g. data engineer to business intelligence engineer, business intelligence engineer to data analyst or data scientist) have had a great deal of overlap, which has made it difficult for business-specific roles to know which role to request in order to get someone with a desired skill set. The lack of distinction between duties of business intelligence roles has meant that managers often hire someone as one data role and expect them to do the work of another role (e.g. business analyst being asked to perform the duties of a data engineer by building and tuning Redshift tables and views). The resulting mismatch in expectations makes it easier to move laterally if you have been doing the work of another role, but makes it more difficult to get promoted, since your probability of successfully being promoted depends on adequately performing the duties of your role at the level you are in while also performing some of the duties for your role at the next level for the role.  The mismatch in expectations is also a factor in attrition, because it becomes highly possible to do what was asked of you, at a high level, but to not get promoted because of the misalignment between what you were asked to do and what is expected of someone with your title.  Much of the misunderstanding is not any manager's fault, but is almost to be expected when your manager fundamentally doesn't understand what you do. It is customary for Software Development Engineers (SDE) at Amazon to work under more-experienced SDEs who participate in code reviews and can provide mentoring in how to advance as an SDE at Amazon. Business Intelligence Engineers and Analysts more often work directly for business managers or customers who have hired them precisely because they can't perform the function themselves at the level need to operate their corner of the business. As a result, an SDE may have the opportunity to work for someone who is better than she is at estimating how long a piece of code will take to write, whereas a business intelligence professional might work for someone who doesn't even know what language they program in or how long it takes to produce a simple snippet of code in it. It is not in the business manager's role description to have to learn how the business intelligence engineer does her job-- only to be able to gauge how "accurate" the results are-- but it means that business intelligence roles have to drive their careers and proactively find their community to get better at their job here. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is something of which you should be aware before you come here.  Another disappointing reality of being a business intelligence person at Amazon is that you are largely expected to be a data vending machine-- the product managers or executives need data for decision making and come to you in a panic to produce some data under a deadline that gives them scant time to give you the context you need to understand the request. You are often placed in a situation where you have to cajole the context out of them in a series of curt or cursory email exchanges only to have them take what you have produced and make decisions based on it in a meeting that you are not allowed to attend. From time to time you meet with a requester who is willing to work collaboratively with you so you both gain something from the exchange, but any person can revert back to a vending machine customer based on the deadlines he or she is facing. The result is that the data professional often can't gain a complete view of what makes the business side so special unless switches to working on the business side either entirely or temporarily. Making such a switch can be beneficial if you aren't sure what you want to do, but frustrating if you already know you want to be a data professional.  I mentioned that the poor role definition often contributed to attrition, and with attrition comes inherited code-- which is one of the worst parts of being a data professional at Amazon. Most of the time when you start on a team you inherit someone else's Frankensteined code-- pasted together from working snippets that have been handed down over generations of people who have inhabited your role. The output of this code has invariably been incorporated into some essential business function or weekly meeting, so if you choose to stay in the role despite the mismatch in what you have been asked to do and what is in the description for your role, you will need to find in between your regular duties to seamlessly fix the code you inherited and replace it with more efficient code without disrupting the processes that depend upon it.  If you have the patience to deal with these problems, at the end of it you will be seasoned, but it is worth setting goals ahead of time as to what you would like to learn so that you can determine when you have had enough, because you are going to lose a level or two in the exchange. Amazon sets your incoming job level based on the assumption that a data role is harder here than a similar role at a smaller company. They are largely correct, but the added difficulty of your role at Amazon is often not due to complexity that is constructive to growth should you leave Amazon, but due to the yoke of proprietary systems that were built to accommodate operational scale, but are useless at a smaller company. Levels largely don't matter, but if you come in at too low a level, you might get stuck doing data vending machine work when you are capable of doing more, even though you can't prove you are ready to do more complex analyses if all you do is vending machine work. It is a bit of a Catch 22: if you slot someone in a role that lower than their skill level, they are precluded from the opportunity to demonstrate they can perform at a higher level.	0.20231593314507676	0.25690984114299176	0.3027301138157733	0.08000927094287538	0.15803484095328285

Premier Engineering (not a long term carreer job opportunity) Fair to above average salary compared to the industry averages and a good work environment for those who know how to play the corporate game well (without stabbing your co-workers in the back). Microsoft has a strange and extremely diskliked process of "Stack Ranking" where each time is required to have 20% below average employees regardless of how good the team actually is. This cause team members to compete more against each other and back stabbing compared to competing against other companies with similar products and doing so as a team. Also if you stay in the same position long enough then they will tell you that you are no longer "growing" and should look for another job and then a year later they may ask you to leave.	0.15510780175152775	0.1922198648786614	0.1985190637473304	0.2624550229043387	0.19169824671814176

Risk Analyst Great exposure to different organizations within the company. Good networking opportunities. Working with smart and capable people. Benefits are OK, but worse if compared to other tech companies. Employees are considered to be disposable. Low pay, especially if you are getting promoted. Basically being promoted into a position you won't get more than 5% increase in pay, while a new employee in the same position may be making 20% more than you do.

Work Hard, Have Fun, Make History I started at Amazon as a skeptic, but 2.5 years in now, I'm a full convert. Amazon is full of opportunities both in terms of career growth and business impact. It's also a company chock full of talented people who will challenge you and help you to become a better version of yourself. I am happy to be part of such an innovative and fast moving company and look forward to contributing for years to come. Like any large company, there are good and bad parts, good and bad managers, good and bad businesses. With that said, the good far outweighs the bad across the board, otherwise you wouldn't see so much success. If you're looking for a place where someone will hold your hand, spoon feed you requirements and coddle you all along the way, Amazon isn't the place for you. If you're willing to grow, be challenged, take risks and innovate, then you'll be very happy.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375

Not as good as it first appears. Benefits weren't bad, employee discount was nice, and working from home was great (at first). In 2013, I would have given this job 4 or 5 starts. Since then, management has totally disregarded all employee feedback and has implemented new policies that are universally despised by the front line workers at AppleCare. Work-life balance has become nonexistent.

Nice place overall, has its pros and cons like every other... Some really smart and technical people to work with and lots of potential to learn.

Lot of opportunities to switch between Good pay, benefits and employee friendly Lot of mismanagement, bad review process resulting in demotivated employees Too big a company with a lot of teams lacking proper vision and leadership, re-strategizing and redoing what's been done over and over again.

Mac Genius Apple only hires the best of the best. I felt like I was working on an amazing team with brilliant minds. The opportunity for advancement is there if you just push yourself. Discounts are amazing 500$ off a mac every few years on top of that an additional 25%. The company also stands by their customers and really do care. Becoming Genius also means a three week stay in Cupertino which is an amazing experience in itself. Work politics can be a pain. There is always that one person that drank a little too much of the apple punch. After sometime it just seemed like management was very verbatim over everything as if it was straight from the apple guidelines. Also the pay was not worth all the work. Overbooked queues and understaffed. Meaning more work for the Family Room with no pay increase.	0.2172409879624951	0.22138564712586747	0.1339994387608098	0.20267733031743027	0.22469659583339738

Vary smart people but work environment is a grind You will learn from the best and will be constantly challenged to go above and beyond. Experience at Amazon is easily marketable to other retail or ecommerce related companies. Most likely in any new workplace you will keep thinking about customers first and customer obsession as the way to win. Work life balance is very poor. You need to have thick skin because it is not a culture where achievements receive lots of praise. Most often you will be asked to think along the lines "What could be done better?".

A career I never expected The continuous growth and development of this company, and its diversity, means there really is opportunity to develop yourself and build a career that truly is limitless.

This gives rise to a true community feel within the company in which everyone is approachable. If your own core values align with foundation of the company culture and direction, this really does become an addictive and enjoyable place to work, and you become proud of the Amazonian DNA that defines you as a leader in the company, at every level! A company that progresses and grows this quick means you are continuously learning, and staying ahead of the curve means hard work and dedication, as well as key time management, whilst not necessarily a Con for most, it does lead to a relentless challenge and you need to be intrinsically motivated for this environment, be able to identify and recognize your own successes with a desire and passion for what truly makes this company tick.

Excellent place to get an incredibly unique experience Excellent culture, access to source code of most projects, open borders. You can work on virtually anything you find interesting, and job is incredibly rewarding. the company is slowly, yet steadily becoming more conservative in approach.

Variety is great but don't confuse it with inconsistency managers. People - the way that we recruit diverse and interesting people. Put them all together and it's just amazing - if only the rest of the world could follow suit as it's changed the way i think and interact with the world around me. Say the right things to the right people to get on. I know real life is like this but it's not really apple.

Beware of gaslighting Microsoft is a great place to launch or hone a career if you land in a department where the managers are focused on utilizing their people effectively and are genuinely invested in growing their teams in meaningful ways. You will have an opportunity to work with and learn from a ton of very smart people. You will enjoy good benefits. Some departments and mangers use gaslighting as the method of choice for obfuscating internal politics and manipulating department outcomes. If, for example, a department wants to stretch its headcount dollars to add extra heads without officially getting any new headcount budget, managers will make it their fulltime jobs to convert a sufficient number of good performers into bad performers through review management techniques that slingshot off a review system that requires an employee and the employee’s colleagues to serve up areas of vulnerability under the disguise of opportunities for growth. In reality, there is generally nothing egregiously wrong with the employee’s performance. It is just that the employee happens to have fallen into the path of the manager’s short-term measure of success and so will be chewed up and spit out. Generally, you became this person by performing well and being paid fairly for your first several years of good service.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Okay The only pro in my opinion is the pay versus the same kind of job at other companies. Hourly you can make 2-7 dollars more than the same job at another warehouse job not even being management. Also 3 days off a week. The con depend on the specific place shift dept ect. I have bounced around and found my biggest issues to be the temperature extremes and rate required of work. Other things are management. There's simply too many people for you to matter. It is what it is.

Great benefits & technology . . . Microsoft offers an exceptional benefits and compensation package. I believe if you have a solid professional background you will be able to negotiate a good comp package + signing bonus. Personally, I love to give to charities and truly appreciate the company match up to $15k. Microsoft provides a good deal of opportunity for growth - if you take it. Good technology. I found Microsoft to be too internally focused. Limited opportunities for promotions for most people. Many people are in the same level for years with limited promotion. Calibration still exists, which wouldn't be a CON if it wasn't so subjective. Basically, if you aren't playing an internally focused game, you will be at risk on your rewards. Again - one of my PROS is the compensation. Therefore, while there might be lots of back-stabbing politics to play on the corporate campus, you might still take home a good wallet. Personally, I prefer to work around people with greater integrity. Given Microsoft's focus on collaboration / productivity solutions, I was blown away by the demand for F2F meetings. It takes a great deal of time to gain consensus and get things done. Limited budgets.	0.2145463666352918	0.1028949444103578	0.23717249291011244	0.27760983442420534	0.1677763616200328

The pay when you take into consideration the stock grants are above average. It is not possible to maintain a work life balance and do well at MS. The current rating system despite announcements of its demise were misstated and is still in full force at MS.

Avoid EMEIA DFA in Europe Finance Apple, collectively, is full of passionate, smart, and driven individuals. People hold themselves to high standards and great attention to details. Everyone wants to do what's best for our customers. Unfortunately, there are really bad eggs in the London office. There is a lot of focus on doing non-value-add type of work. Managers tend to play favourites and isolate those who disagree with them, even if their points can be extremely valid. People seems to be promoted based on tenure rather than aptitude. You have to kiss up to you boss to advance in your career. These comments only extend to the European finance team.

Every day is a little different and there is always something to do. The facilities are pretty clean overall. HR employees are rarely on site, for assistance, Management and HR don't seem too communicate enough, employees status get lost in the shuffle as a result of this, The company isn't honest enough with employees about new openings within company, Trusted and dependable employees with most tenure aren't suggested for any middle management positions in the company.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Excellent company, but not for everyone Great for learning. Fast-paced. Learn how to get things done. Fantastic pay & benefits. Easy access to senior folks. The higher management are full of visionaries and serve as an inspiration for the rest of the company. Internal mobility is quite hard. Sometimes, even good people struggle to survive in the company due to very high expectations. Here, you are either continuously moving forward or you get out of the way - you cannot remain at the same level of performance for a long time.	0.19336955886612628	0.2011967034573396	0.16843566358461676	0.2502083445242397	0.18678972956767764

Customer obsessed, employee blind A leader, a fast paced, innovative high hitter. Great for the CV and for experience. Totally customer focussed which is genuine and propagates through all levels. None of the company values truly focus on the employee. They just don't care. The remuneration is complex and not as rewarding as the competition.

Great Company for Some - Team Dependent In my 1.5 years at Amazon, I have worked on two different teams (regular rotation a major pro in itself), and I have had a great experience on one team and a less than great on another team. Overall, its cool to work for an innovative company that's working on genuinely interesting projects. The promotion process is fairly opaque, and some teams have a culture of promoting those to management who aren't good managers.	0.19576232151794884	0.22410465897103946	0.1939831198052384	0.21940085878816448	0.1667490409176088
You will burn out.... Incredibly smart people everywhere, you will learn a lot and tackle challenging problems. Higher than average pay. You will work on problems beyond your pay-grade and experience. Amazon will burn you out. You will be asked to work unsustainable hours, 60+ all the time and ask for more. They don't care about you or your life. Everyone is always new because people burn out and leave. This place is a meat grinder.  Promotions are an act of god, despite your accomplishments, efforts, skill, leadership. Amazon prefers to hire management from outside, so plan on not promoting because they do not care to promote from within.	0.18916431418203353	0.17956763734699704	0.13803901413588746	0.2638170985840844	0.22941193575099764
It depends on which department you work at... avoid IS&T Apple discount is ok. When you start, you will receive a $500 bonus to be used every 3 years so buy something immediately. 25% off one item from each product family per year - desktop, ipads, iphone, etc. 15% for up to three friends every year. If you work in IS&T and you love project management, then this is for you. Every IS&T department team is governed by the onshore and offshore vendor model primarily from India companies. If you enter as a developer, you will be involuntarily assigned to work as a technical program/project manager role where you will delegate all your code to onshore and offshore developers. Sometimes you'll get good developers, but most of the time, you'll get mediocre or below-average developers. There is no diversity in this department as the overall ethnicity is 99.999% India descent. Most of the senior managers are not technical, not hands-on and rely solely on the program/project managers/consultants to deliver all projects for them. The technical knowledge is heavily relied on the consultant/contractor engineers. The performance reviews can be conducted arbitrarily and can be tweaked at the discretion of the manager. It depends on the manager's integrity and honor if he/she will base your performance on merit. Over time, the more you do project management work, the less you will do technical work unless you put in long hours at night. The management team will do whatever possible to protect themselves and avoid all risk. There is a lot of politics and arrogance. One director hired most of her managers from her previous company. Everyone who knew the director ascended to management ranks by this association. So either it is by coincidence or maybe cronyism? If you don't belong in that "3com club", then you will not be as richly compensated. e.g. The managers brag to their employees about buying and/or rebuilding 1- 3 million dollar homes (ground up) in areas of Saratoga, Cupertino, and Evergreen.  Just to emphasize, this is for the Apple IS&T department. All other product development teams - iCloud, iTunes, etc. will not have this environment. Furthermore, it can be confirmed that those departments are more diverse in ethnicities, rely on badged employees for development work, and work long hours depending on the team and project.	0.1706631671631781	0.23184992998037923	0.25636960609929044	0.23519398207088768	0.10592331468626456
Experience will depend on the team and project One of the best work life balances out there. Not everyone is at the same stage of their careers and not all products are at the same stage either. This means you'll easily find motivated engineers mismatched onto maintenance mode products going nowhere and with size comes a dilution of talent.	0.18242495668027664	0.2198715436796998	0.2059154854367341	0.19688554509700568	0.19490246910628373

Great place to work - as long as you are a hard worker! They really do like to have fun! Also, excellent benefits, stock units, company discount online - and monthly bonuses are great! If you like to work, this is the place for you. Hard work is appreciated, expected, and rewarded. TONS of learning opportunities. Upward mobility for those who aim for it. Break rooms have lots of great, affordable options. If you can't be on time, don't bother applying. You have to be dedicated. I really don't have any cons. When reading reviews, take into consideration the tone in which they are written. The majority of the "con" issues I have read is from disgruntled associates who can't manage their time or goof off at work and wonder why their managers call them out on it.	0.1775174821517882	0.20188984348075126	0.21075335401249673	0.2129266959073701	0.19691262444759364
Good Company in transition I enjoyed Microsoft. However, it has changed greatly since when I joined in 2006. It's still a first-class company but not as much leading-edge any more. Microsoft seems so busy trying to latch on to a successful strategy that it's having difficultly with consistency. The recent lay off of almost 8000 people is something that never would've happened 10 years ago. And it's okay for shareholders, but less okay if you work there.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Good people twisted by performance review process old or new. - Very good salary. - Good bonuses if your peers allow it. - A lot of flexibility in your time management. - If you are a horn tooter you will succeed. - Work is piled in a way that you can flexibly decide when to work 16 hours per day. - The ranking system seems to be gone, but the internal culture and people still enforce it. In the review system there is a "check box" equivalent to a rank of Underperforming. - You can do your job perfectly (no errors) and on time and still be pushed to an Underperforming status compared to your peers. - If you care a lot about your work's result this company may or may not be a good fit for you, it all depends on how many tasks you can perform at the same time.	0.19151597927577407	0.24564886712500789	0.17794956836369322	0.22841873442509777	0.156466850810427

Customer Services Great bunch of people to work with, colleagues are amazing, all in same boat and tend to keep each other going but no one stays because they like it there. Management needs a shake, somewhere along the way the recruitment got bad, the decent people have moved on and left Ireland with no one competent enough to run the place either economically or fairly. Do not take a job here hoping that your hard work will pay off, it won't. but you will work yourself into the ground before you realise it is time to move on. In the normal scheme of things you could join a company and know that they will recruit from within if the talent is there.

Plenty of smart people. A "cool" atmosphere with beer bashes and famous bands coming to visit. All the comforts of a large company, yet maintains an energy of execution similar to many start-ups. Some dinosaur rotten apples in middle management that are nothing more than political animals. There can also be territorial disputes over who-does-what that are usually not properly resolved from the highest levels. People who need to talk to each other are sometimes overwhelmed and have no time, so communication often suffers. The culture of secrecy is often frustrating.	0.21323472248050446	0.27917506648688833	0.063635493096276	0.25675359647336243	0.18720112146296888

Apple Retail (Cupertino HQ) - great company, strange culture Very bright co-workers, dedication to higher goals, commitment to quality, the front line people in the stores are great. Senior management was infiltrated by retail clothing managers who did not understand technology, were very focused on the fashion they wore each day and their primary skill was often an ability to play court politics.  There is also an almost cult like self-improvement culture. Except senior managers (director level) don't apply it to themselves. So everyone below them should be open to "feedback" at all times, but not if you're in a management role because then you're showing vulnerability and how would that look?	0.23346518859798115	0.12974192029184314	0.22046837051979068	0.2617384027958485	0.1545861177945365

Fast paced, frenetic environment. Customer comes first. Employees last. Challenging projects and smart driven people can make it fun when things are going well and management is aligned.

Amazingly Intelligent People but No Work Life Balance * Learn from the best * Plenty of opportunity to move around - (If you last long enough) * Decent to Good Compensation - (but maybe not so much if you divide by the number of hours you work.) * Compensation is good related to cost of living in Seattle * No work life balance. Working long hours, 12 plus a day, is common and a badge of honor. * Working holidays and weekends is common - especially Thanksgiving and Christmas - but ofcourse this is a commerce company. * Turnover rate is pretty high. Average employee lasts 1.5 years * Lots of burnt-out employees. * "It is what it is" is a common phrase heard around the company when asking employees if they like the long hours. * Very competitive work culture. Lots of nice people but most don't have much time to give guidance. * Bad documentation and little training make it difficult to get up to speed. Be prepared to have lots of work and responsibility thrown at you from day one. * Culture of frugality means little investment in employee training and perks. *	0.12371137900827243	0.18889851835810956	0.1950888740421372	0.3039153154093922	0.18838591318208864

As call centers go, it's pretty awful No pros, everything that made me like the job was a blatant lie. Has health insurance so that's something. The work is monotonous and draining. The chat team was dissolved, and then they shifted my hours to meet 'business needs' which took away the last bit of faith I had that they care about the employee. Supposedly you can choose from set shifts, but the time you pick is randomly assigned, meaning if you're randomly assigned to pick last, then there are no good options left. Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive. Even the free drinks are slowly being taken away, we have stupid lemon water options now or espresso, which I can't drink. This job has given me anxiety, I am actively looking for a different job and will quit the moment I'm able.	0.19520377119525634	0.1686272841291846	0.2455897018798445	0.2070104766803286	0.18356876611538608
Great employer with a high regard for it's employees. Could make better use of them with some cultural adjustments My 20 months at Microsoft were filled with a lot of learning, personal growth and development. My team (Windows Live Safety Platform) was a very energetic team with very high bars for quality and agility. I had a fantastic mentor who also happened to be one of the smartest people I've ever worked with. While at times it did feel like the company was too big and that some decisions could be made faster, it almost always felt understandable. I heard complaints about other areas of the firm, but my own personal experience was fantastic. Like I said, sometimes felt too big. Was hard to know everything that was going on, and some decisions felt like they were top down. But this was rare and for the most part the company believed in hiring bright people and letting them run with things	0.19032662170507136	0.1904111096326077	0.22115267299229308	0.2258213066038377	0.17228828906619023

I stayed for the money... I had a really good team of managers that gave me tons of guidance from inbound direct functions, workers comp is decent, Short breaks, lunch is scheduled, TOT: time off task (you must scan something every 4 minutes, if you don't you get written up), peak season is hell (50-60 hour shifts), you're tracked all the time by an RF gun, you're on your feet for 10 hours straight, mandatory overtime is something you can't get out of unless you use your allotted time, going to amcare is useless if you really need it, you get moved around to different positions you weren't initially hired for, making mistakes is evident in any job but you're only allowed to make so very few but must maintain good quality and a high rate of production.	0.12381543501796227	0.23358952456188697	0.22831532143578553	0.23575333861784067	0.17852638036652457

Used to be great, now just a normal corporate. Not a place for work life balance. Pay standard is still good. Good benefits and perks. Management's efforts for transparency is still better than most companies. People are still better than most companies. When I joined Google 7 years ago, I used to be amazed at people and culture every day. Over the time as the company grows to a large corporate with more hierarchy and corporate politics and most of founding management left, it's now just a normal company with corporate double talks and lack of transparency from management. People and culture are still better than most companies but not amazing any longer. Also company wide issue is detaching from work. Over many years here, I've never seen a college doing well without doing overtime (might be possible in a large operational team though). People may leave the office early but will dial back in to work at night. It was okay when I was single but not when I need family time with 2 small kids. Burn outs are quite common as the performance evaluation is based on comparison to your peers who are bright talents and work 24/7.	0.1927609148171997	0.20056342292993387	0.19133295714120482	0.2486634413969333	0.16667926371472813
Retail vs. Corporate Great medical benefits and occasional perks such as new devices. Poor work life balance. We almost never get our schedules more than a few days before the new work week. Even then, they change nearly daily and you get push back if you dared to make plans on a day that you had off on one of the previous versions. Be prepared to perform duties above and beyond what your job description calls for with no training, no raise, no extra compensation. Just a whole lot of stress and very low morale. Reviews are only given when you hound management, and even then don't expect a raise. There is NO pathway from the retail level to corporate if you are not coding or designing.	0.13005346421925362	0.13854306535578814	0.2395649148321446	0.23823430036526907	0.2536042552275445

Genius Great Part-time job in college. Tough as a full time job working inside a retail store. Corporate best option for less stress (not having to deal with customer's directly). If you have a degree with no experience, it is real tough to get into corporate. Only way is to try out through "experiences/paid internships". You usually have to go through two to get in and they last 6 months in California or Austin. Position is not guaranteed afterward.

Think carefully before accepting a position at Amazon Fulfillment Centers. Pay is quite high. Be mindful though and do the math... most compensation is tied to tenure ...from signing bonuses, for RSUs (restricted stock units), as well as yearly increases all are tied to a vesting schedule that is up to 4 years long on most occasions. We do this for two reasons... 1) retention is horrifically low at fulfillment centers so anything to incentivize tenure (we're not above bribery!). 2) The vast majority of Amazon managers have very short tenures at Amazon, so few make it through to the end of their vesting schedule and they therefor never realize their full compensation. So it's easy to offer a high rate of pay when one knows most managers will never realize their full compensation.  The ego boost for working for such a respected brand is enticing. Amazon is fully aware of this and will leverage it as needed.  Promotional opportunities exist if you are willing to relocate.  You will work with some really bright folks who are driven and motivated. Be aware of what you see online (Linkedin, Facebook, Web career site, etc.) about community involvement, volunteerism, corprate team building exercises and the 'look at how much fun we are having and how amazing it is to work here!!!' vibe is/are 100% corporate ativities. They do not exist in the field, in any capacity, whatsoever. It's simply marketing to entice candidates.  Amazon is a 24/7/365 business. So expect to work overnights as well. Yes the recruiter will deftly avoid answering schedule questions, yes even if you are lucky enough to initially get a coveted day shift. Yes regardless of your kids, husband/wife's schedule. Reality is people transfer, resign or get promoted all at breakneck speed at Amazon which means in very short order there will be a vacancy on overnight that needs to be filled... you can protest but it won't do much good.  Communication is sorely lacking. Communication to help shape a common purpose or best practices or really anything is almost non-existent in the Amazon Fresh business. It doesn't exist in the business as a whole nor in any building I've worked in.  Zero work life balance. I've heard rumors that Jeff Bezos himself said he hates that term. The culture reflects that.  Within a Fulfillment Center you will never work less than a 12hr day. My experience is that 14hr-16hr days for myself and my peers is the expectation and the norm. That is 5 days a week and you can expect your boss to call/email/text you on your days 'off'. By the way this is in no way tied to a peek season schedule.... this has been the norm my whole time at Amazon whether it's December or June. Keep in mind that you will be on your feet almost the entire 12-16hr shift there are no offices (nor almost any tables or chairs) in Amazon Fresh buildings. Kind of a funny aside... people at Amazon (due to work schedule and stress I believe) all look older than they are. There are plenty of red sunken eyes, heavy heads, premature wrinkles really just general body language that screams 'I'm tired'.  One of Amazon's Leadership Principles is 'Frugality'. Generally a good principal to live by, I believe. It is a negative though as it pertains to associate incentives, moral and recognition at Amazon Fresh. No matter how hard folks work on completing some genuinely difficult projects or tasks there is a miniscule budget to run contests or recognize outstanding contribution. You would hope that someone in Seattle would acknowledge that an occasional pizza party won't impact profitability terribly and can just be a genuinely thoughtful gesture that would be appreciated. But alas that is not the case.  I could go on about a number of other 'con's but in short... Amazon treats its employees (from associates to level 7+ managers) as commodities to be exploited. Chances are excellent this work will cause you and your family significant stress due to extremely long hours and time away from home. Even during your limited time away from work you will be so tired and fried that you will be a mere shell of your former self.  If you are prepared to basically give up a personal life, family, vacation, working out ...really everything not Amazon related and pick up an oar on a 1st century ship crossing the ocean than Amazon is for you. After all the money is good. You might be that one in a hundred who has a fulfilling career in an FC but chances are excellent you will dislike the job and if you can afford to, you will leave as so many before you have. Good luck you beautiful, unique, amazing snowflake if you decide to join!	0.13244797383952187	0.1641383047621885	0.20839343719486286	0.17679295864408098	0.31822732555934574

Corporate Culture Spotty w CEO Transition, Beware of career/long-time Microsofties Smart, ambitious, energetic, fast-moving people. Lots of opportunity to work with people across the organization. Opportunities to have many different types of careers and roles within one company. In fact, they encourage you to move around which is fabulous. Great benefits and compensation package and on-campus amenities. Career Microsoft people (10+ years) with slightly old mindset are prevalent all over the company. They tout wanting outside perspectives but stick to old ways. It could be that the new CEO Satya Nadella's philosophy and management style has not reached all organizations yet especially the sales & business side. Senior management imposes a lot of accountability without providing authority, which can be dangerous for those not politically-savvy (like the long-timers). The old comic strip about Microsoft's "organizational hierarchy" showing teams pointing guns at each other is now more understandable as I experienced it first-hand. Also, overly high reliance on vendors.	0.16052173595251049	0.20416598553359258	0.2160921190183628	0.22423141876707325	0.19498874072846095

Slowly returning once again to a common goal and single purpose Massive install base for software - the ability to influence the lives of millions Program Managers who have to design products can be held back because the company is too big to move quickly and test and iterate with customers in comparison to smaller players with less brand equity at stake. Being several layers removed from customer interaction makes for challenging decisions that are made in windowless offices driven by data that is not necessarily telling the whole story.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375
Warehouse Good hours. They give you free coffee and tea. During the interview process they tell you that if you take the midnight shift you will be paid a dollar more. So that means you’ll get $14.50. That is not true at all, you have to wait a month before even getting that salary plus you cap out at $15.75. When I finally got the job which took a month for them to get back to me, the guy who trained my group was completely lazy and didn’t care one bit about us new people. He didn’t show us certain things which caused all of us receive 2 points before even being there for a week. It was a complete nightmare. People are for themselves and when your new they treat you differently . I know everyone has a different experience. Then to top it off I was sexually harassed by some loser who didn’t know when to leave me alone so I quit after being there for a short. I filed a complaint but still no word.

Initially innovative, exciting, and fast paced while meeting interesting people and hopefully making their lives better. If getting hours is what you want, this is the place to work. If you aren't scheduled you can always find someone who wants time off. Benefits are ok, especially the employee stock purchase program. Co-workers are interesting, talented, skilled individuals with vast interests outside of work. They are quality people to meet and befriend. You get personal and family/friend discounts on the products. No one works on commission so it creates a better team environment when trying to help a customer. You must enjoy interacting with people from all walks of life to do this job. Shirts are provided and no other uniform requirements. It's a decent place to work short term. Personal growth seems limited. They like to hire from outside and not promote from within. The don't like to promote older employees and opt for younger, "hipper" individuals even if they have less experience or skill. It seems the more eccentric you are, the greater the chances you get hired. Compensation is average, with predictable annual increases, even though some locations exceed forecasted revenue. It's a cookie cutter one size fits all award system There are no special financial awards for exceeding goals, etc for the average employee. Christmas bonus has consisted of a sweatshirt the last few years. They want ridiculous availability for scheduling (full time has to have 100% availability for all days the store is open), and they will push part time to full time hours during holiday to avoid over time for full time employees. This basically eliminates a work-life balance. There is a high burn out rate. Someone there one year is a seasoned veteran! Time off availability is a bit variable. During training, there are certain values they speak of that they want practiced by the employees toward the customer and each other, but they do not practice those values toward the employees themselves. It has so much promise but falls short.	0.16229788218072694	0.22637731114418377	0.219076449284658	0.20419646132178818	0.18805189606864298

Learn how to  The company has given me a lot. I've had steady growth until I became a Senior (every 1 1/2 years of promos) and had the pleasure of working with some wonderful bright people. The benefits are great and work life balance is much under your control. I have been involved in different projects in the same team every 2 years which kept my enthusiasm high as I was learning something new often.  If you are an entry level person looking to gain knowledge, Microsoft is a good start. If you don't have aspirations of being a VP then get out by the time you become a Senior. It's just not worth dealing with the "politics". - The review system encourages "networking" or as I like to call it brown nosing in many instances. - Not everybody can keep trending up, but they can still do a wonderful job. The company does a poor job of recognizing that. - The move to combined engineering is a mess. We have managers who want to transition to the new agile methods but want to apply waterfall evaluation methods, which doesn't make sense. The next few years is going to be a make or break for employees and many could be frustrated with the half assed move to combined engineering. - Moving to new teams is not easy, lots of openings do not get published in the internal career site. - Testers and Developers are evaluated differently. Testers are expected to do a little bit of everything, i.e. PM, Dev & Test while Developers aren't. In the combined engineering model, this mode of operation will not fly. - Senior testers who are now merged with Developers will find it hard to "compete" with their Dev counterparts, as testers are now expected to be more Dev's than Testers. It's not a level playing field anymore. - Testing in self is going on the wayside at Microsoft. While some rethinking of testing is done is necessary, I don't think the current approach of letting Scrum teams do all their testing is going to fly. Look at some of the reviews of the Microsoft apps in the store, they are horrendous.	0.20527643000343082	0.15352179348491057	0.21182139967772726	0.24355915753172225	0.1858212193022091

Area Manager- Run far away! pay looks alright but for hours not worth it was told that i would have occassional nights and occasional weekends, and a trip to seattle paid every year. No trip to seattle for AMs and i was on Sunday-wednesday night shift. 14 hour days sometimes makes the salary divide into an hourly wage less than the associates during peak you just feel taken advantage of. Mom got sick and I had to move back home- they were unable to transfer me so told me they would forgive my starting bonus and relocation payback after almost a year of working for them. I get a call that they want almost $7000 back and will take legal action a few months later, they force me to pay it back. This company does not care about its people it expects you to enforce dumb rules on your 100 person teams and become like a robot, ridiculous hours, working over holidays, starting bonus and relocation have to be repaid if you leave before 2 years, which almost no one makes it to. lost 8 managers in 3 months in our building.	0.09536932989546844	0.20317813760338874	0.1796143009014429	0.24609647342367172	0.2757417581760282

Lots of promise but ultimately frustrating because of internal politics. The technical challenges and opportunities at Amazon are huge. You work with incredibly smart people on incredibly hard problems. You will learn a lot that will help with the rest of your career. There is always way more to do than you can reasonably accomplish. Most teams are understaffed. Amazon has a "frugality" leadership principle, which in reality means many things are underfunded and projects are harder to deliver as a result. Also, Amazon still uses the discredited stack ranking and forced curving in its "performance" reviews. The predictable result is aggressive internal competition, backstabbing, and other political bs. They'd be better off promoting teamwork and rewarding joint achievements.	0.16892264779164315	0.2145055504772569	0.16808579619157132	0.25439652011908825	0.1940894854204404
Happiness is dependant on managers, most are like children so you're going to be unhappy here. Some good colleagues who are there for you and make it worth while, some good benefits, but sometimes tricky to be eligible for them. Lots of game playing, opportunities only given to favourites, special treatment given to favourites who are basically yes men and agree with management no matter what, structure of how to progress and what's right and wrong is in dire need of fixing and reorganising.	0.1828523486125498	0.1858624240933001	0.24966378368252024	0.26312083210063153	0.11850061151099837

solid lifetime career Started at the company at mid-point in my career and continued to work as an FTE, CSG and vendor for over 20 years. Now that I'm taking roles at other small companies I can see how lucky I was during my time at Msft. The interviewing process results in the hiring of some of the smartest people in this field. The education level, drive to succeed and mutual respect between colleagues is not standard practice at smaller companies in the U.S. If you're a current employee, value what you have and realize it's not like that everywhere in the business world. It's become a big corporation that can no longer turn on a dime. Performance reviews are top of mind for too many, rather than building and shipping fantastic products.	0.19412907154841955	0.20417063903815458	0.19259396591284386	0.22419008287925357	0.18491624062132841

This company likes to put band-aids over broken bones. The other employees are great to work with and a few of the managers actually do care. They always need help so overtime is no problem. Low pay for the area. The managers only see what they want to see. There's no follow through with anything. No actions are taken on people who don't follow the rules. Carbon copy yearly review process. Unless you're a "popular kid" with the managers than you're going no where in the company. The managers don't care what you have to say unless your nose is brown. The office area is like a playground, they're always throwing stuff at each other and playing games.	0.2666944016648236	0.1339910798024506	0.3540397297209888	0.13997976476773358	0.10529502404400326

Very low quality of leadership and management skills The pay isn't bad, they start off at 11.50 part time. They pay a substantial amount of tuition if you are in school or plan on going to school, the most i've ever heard a company would pay. Work and life balance is horrible, you have no life if you work here. The leadership at this company is terrible, the managers weren't doing a very good job with management. The HR department was the worst i've ever seen. They were constantly messing up on payroll and then taking weeks to fix it, so I wouldn't get paid until a week or two after the original pay date. You work 10hrs a day, but I didn't mind that too much. It seems once you get into upper management or supervisor level you don't do much of anything but walk around the warehouse. Too many times I noticed how a lot of the managers and supervisors weren't doing anything but walking around talking about the workers and just goofing off. The work ethic of upper management was poor.	0.15455715682966856	0.3275274877900033	0.12700045444918526	0.2116674240819754	0.1792474768491674

Amazon Prime Now Personal Shopper Nice working conditions, our work station is in a corner of a Whole Foods and it's clean. People are nice. 10% discount online. Decent wage of $15 USD and a somewhat flexible* schedule. *Scheduling is unfair and unpredictable, new shifts are posted 3 times a week at a certain time. They are ALL taken within a minute or less. I haven't had an opportunity to work in 3 weeks because of this. You literally have to sit on your computer or phone hoping your browser loads faster than everyone else, considering you are competing with 50+ people for 10 shifts or so. Very poor communication with management and a useless 1-800 number to some call center in India only to tell you to talk to your manager. Glassdoor is the closest thing I can find for Amazon Prime Now feedback and I hope somebody reads this.  Besides the scheduling issues, I genuinely enjoy this job.

Challenging work environment. Great benefits package if you're lucky enough to get full-time. There was a very diverse group of people on the team and we felt like a big family. Very difficult to get full-time in any position within the retail store. In-store management team was virtually powerless, everything from quantity of hours available to promotions/role changes were left in the hands of the market leaders (who didn't really have any idea what was needed). Hours were highly unpredictable, which made it nearly impossible to have a life outside of the store. Very difficult to move within the ranks of the store, they would very often bring in "new hires" from outside the store that would get positions that people who had been working there for years wanted. Very high-stress work environment (particularly at the Genius Bar) and, the pay rate didn't compensate for the demands most of the time. No connection between retail and corporate sides of Apple as far as job movement.	0.22060314889284682	0.14972939862471457	0.231199806699927	0.21709773834938745	0.18136990743312414

I've worked a total of 24 years in tech--this is the best work experience I've had so far The company has principles that it believes in and uses to guide daily business decisions. These are not the usual nonsense "values" or "competencies" most companies have but never use. WE USE THEM.  Customers come first. Everything we do (not joking) is based on, "Is this best for our customers?"  You own your work. What you accomplish is based on what you accomplish. No living year to year by blaming others strategically. Get things done. Period.  We are more than fairly compensated. We work a lot of hours and sacrifice some nights and weekends, but at least we are paid well. There is no way to work here and work a 40-hour or 45-hour week. A great commitment is required, and sometimes, your family and friends don't understand it.  As with all companies, some managers can be real dicks. Par for the course.  People who work from home are often viewed with suspicion and preyed upon. Again, not unlike a lot of companies.	0.18309931587756523	0.22068432938841348	0.19855812374815335	0.20203527782406955	0.19562295316179829
Tough place to leave. When I first joined it became apparent that this was what had happened to the hippy movement. They adapted, incorporated and set out to make some very cool toys. This innovative company's culture fosters an OCD - like attention to detail while embracing open dialogue and mutual respect. The people and the relationships forged in this company are oftentimes the highlights of anyone's career experience. The culture is indeed rich but it only takes one or two individuals to abuse it by using it's almost utopian communication style as a weapon to serve their own means.	0.20685810924123088	0.20694993566460407	0.21345350868306415	0.24543580972524276	0.1273026366858582

Amazing place if you prefer running to walking/standing Keep in mind, all of this is the experience of a senior engineer in a particular group. YMMV.  + Everyone wants their product and Amazon in general to be the market leader. The idea of being an also-ran is totally alien. I can't overstate how great it is for morale for everyone to be so driven. + You see the effects of your work. No matter who your customer(s) is/are, the company makes sure you are connected to them. + An endless number of difficult problems. Even pedestrian engineering tasks become significant at Amazon because of the scale. + Demandingly high but realistic expectations. People at Amazon are smart and competent, and they expect all their coworkers and reports to be smart and competent. You'll rarely feel like one or more bad coworkers are dragging down your team, and on occasion when they do sneak in those coworkers don't last long. Similarly, management isn't in the habit of passing down impossible edicts, because they get called out and pushed back about it when they try. + Transparency and sound, if not perfect, corporate strategy. I've never once been told "do this because I said so". There's always reasons that can be traced to actual needs and desired outcomes, and unless it's an experiment there's typically good data to back it up. Amazon doesn't operate on whims, nor does it waste time on petty vanity projects that can't be shown to provide significant benefit. + A weird combination of stability and flexibility. The company is doing well, so if you're getting your job done there's no chance you're going to get laid off. Promotions are by no means easy, but not as difficult as some make them out to be, and it is very easy to move around at the same level. It's hard to feel like you're trapped in a dead-end job. + Competitive compensation and benefits. Amazon may have been lagging in this regard historically, but they've definitely caught up. The compensation structure is a little strange and some people view it as a reason to quit after two years, but I think that's the exact intention. + Great workspace. The buildings don't have much in the way of flashy extras, but, given that they're in the middle of a major city rather than off in the burbs, they don't really need them. The offices are comfortable and more spacious then I've seen at other big tech firms. The location has lots of good stuff to eat and do within a short walk. Bicycle cages and locker rooms make bike commuting a breeze. + Awesome internal communities, both for work-related and non-work topics. + Good work-life balance. I put this last on the list because it's the least certain. If you have a good manager and take managing your own work and time seriously, you should have no trouble excelling without having to put in extra hours. I work fewer hours at Amazon - not much more than 40/week on average - than I did at companies that have better reputations for work/life balance, because employees are more empowered to make and manage workloads. - All of the above pros may be completely absent in a different role/group/department/location. The company is huge, and despite considerable attempts at SOPs there's quite a bit of variation team-to-team and role-to-role. - You start juggling quite a few balls, and are continuously offered more to juggle as you go. You can't just keep your head down and do the bare minimum and expect to succeed. Some people thrive in this sort of environment, some don't. - The people are more genuinely friendly and less cliquish than I've seen at other companies, but they also don't pull punches. If you screw up, even a sin of omission rather than an actual fault, you'll be sure to hear about it. - SLU is still experiencing growing pains around the company. - It's still a very self-service company, and while the resources for self-service are much better it still means that you have to be very cognizant of the expectations and requirements of your job. Help is almost always available when you run into problems, but you have to ask for it.	0.20253723811894261	0.25654716828399393	0.20253723811894261	0.20034482471662418	0.13803353076149671

Sr. Technical Program Manager I've been with Amazon Alexa team for about 3 months now and am having a very positive experience! Work: Engaging with lots of learning and so much potential now and in the future. Best way for me to feel part of the team was to get a project/work where I could contribute. It was great I got to work on an initiative which did not need Amazon Alexa knowledge in depth but leveraged my experience to streamline and optimize a process improvement in my team. People: Brilliant yet humble and helpful. Most everyone goes out of their way to help you get on-boarded and make you feel part of a team Management: Leadership is very clear with their expectations. They give new comers enough time to get accustomed to the Amazon was and also explaining why things are done the way they are. They give teams enough independence to operate and execute without teams going willy-nilly. They also hold teams accountable with relevant metrics and status meetings. For working parents there is ample Work Life Balance opportunities and never left stressed about family while I've been here. No a con per say but something to know... Alexa is growing rapids and learning curve is steep so be prepared to work smart and hard with brilliant people!	0.19317470717836946	0.16981105600721783	0.3292255167486884	0.20568109603062387	0.10210762403510047

So much talent and potential, lack of execution Great compensation Great benefits Great perks that you truly need and want as an adult (nope, I can do my own laundry thank you very much) Smart, very professional coworkers The review model Lack of direction and vision from the very top Outlook more unclear than ever	0.17983544720873454	0.2227348458099306	0.1937152469555257	0.22461797634288438	0.17909648368292472
Perks are incredible, but even Google has its cons - Perks are the best you'll find anywhere: Food, fancy drinks, baristas, massages, bring your dog to work, fun events every week/month, full relocation benefits, the list goes on... anything you want! - Technology of course: It's great using Gmail/Google for Work products (much better than Microsoft suite that we're all used to outside of Google), and there are high quality cameras/screens in every conference room for meetings on Google Hangouts, making it very easy to work with remote teams - Pay and bonuses: Usually much better vs. other companies, especially since they offer stock units that vest over time and Google stock is worth a lot (though I did hear from other Googlers that they could get paid a lot more at other companies? not sure what they're referring to...). - All in all, it's working for Google, which in itself is a pro and "cool" to many!! - Very competitive atmosphere: People take credit for others' work and there have been many cases where this has happened across several teams. These people want to look better to senior leadership/get more hires/justify their roles. - Different experience dependent on what team you're on: Dynamics vary a lot. Often, your boss must be vocal enough or well liked in order for you to succeed (as the person below them) since you have no access to upper leaders. - Poor Management & Leadership: Just really bad in a lot of cases and don't really know what's going on. Lack of product knowledge and it's very obvious. - Promotions are selective: "Favorites" will often be easily promoted, when others may deserve it more. There is only a certain # of people who can be promoted every cycle. - At times, feels like a sexist environment for women: Males favored, listened to more, and "boys club" mentality at management level. - "Flat" organization but very hierarchical: Try to hire smart, experienced people in at the low level, meaning you must do everything on your own and feels like you're alone on an island of 1 without help or anyone to manage/hire in below you. Managers are usually people who have been at Google for a long time, and they are the ones with access to the senior leadership teams. - Hiring: Takes a long time. They say they only hire "smart people", however, the company is so big now, that's really impossible... many employees are not as smart or cool as Google advertises. - Unwilling to allow transfers to other offices: If you like Mountain View, great! If you do not like Mountain View, which most people do not, good luck with trying to transfer offices and stay in your current role. Internal transfers are also not as easy as advertised. - Bureaucracy: It's a huge company. Don't expect it to be all roses or feel like a small, fun company. There's a lot going on all the time, and you can easily get lost in the shuffle depending on the above re: managers, team, promotions, etc.	0.3206065345255499	0.26717211210462494	0.19236392071532993	0.12042294223642597	0.09943449041806911
Great place to work and impact the world I had the opportunity to impact billions of people. Only a handful of private companies can give you this kind of impact from your contributions. The pay matches the impact you have in the world. Some of the organizational structure is miss matched to the financial structure i.e. products get assigned budget that may not be related to revenue. Makes sense for some products but revenue generators should be able to keep more i.e. product leaders have no real incentive in increasing revenue and decreasing cost. Also the new triad model means most things are done by committee.	0.18228075105839175	0.19170944944567012	0.24187254835875485	0.21050704235651163	0.17363020878067167

More Game of Cards than Engineering Nice Buildings, Free Soft Drinks In 3 years I moved between 5 managers. Layoffs were happening, people were quitting left and right. Things did settle down a bit. What I saw was either a manager likes you or he doesn't. Managers don't check on code, its all about perception. I've seen Engineers work their way up with crappy code. The next guy in line has to clean up the mess. Fixing bugs doesn't earn you points at all.  Senior Leadership ruled like dictators. If you break the dev build (not even prod build), you will be shamed, your checkin privileges are revoked. Abusive language is used at times. This meant the blame game is played. Private emails are forwarded around. Project Managers fresh out of schools are hired to boss you around. A dev only writes code was the mantra.  In 3 years, I slowly felt the soul sucked out of me. They pay you well, but to them you are just a dev who will work 60-70 hours. You'd see people working weekends and late nights. It is highly frowned upon to only work 8 hours.	0.17038014649507838	0.16173642734493257	0.21552779283443982	0.2565915046464996	0.1957641286790497

Good place to work but not always the best people to work with. Great benefits and solid pay. Interesting work. Smart people. Always on the cutting edge of technology. Having come over as a junior member on the support team, I was constantly reminded by other teammates that they had worked at Google longer and, therefore, I didn't matter as much. I was astounded by the superiority complex numerous full-time "Googlers" had toward the temps, vendors, and contractors Google also employs. This attitude also was exhibited toward employees who came to Google via acquisitions. Google likes to stress the point of working on personal initiatives and projects. This unknowingly resulted in the duplication of efforts between locations. If it was discovered that a person in another location was working on a similar project, there was usually a meeting to compare initiatives. If the projects were similar and your peers had seniority over you, you were forced to stop your work even after having invested months on it. At other times co-workers actively stole project plans and claimed as their own. On another occasion, one of my personal projects was "taken over" by a manager who thought my project would benefit their current initiative. I was forced to stop work on my project as it had been transitioned to the manager's team. That said, many of the people are actually quite wonderful. Just keep in mind that as Google grows, there are less ways to be noticed and moving up is more difficult which means many people will try to get ahead any way they can.	0.24708588070800108	0.18826274238230548	0.18754177437492045	0.20676520486522762	0.17034439766954548

Marketing a new product at Google Amazing perks, seriously. I forgot my wallet at home for an entire week and never noticed until the weekend. Everything is onsite at Google. Challenging work environment where you can learn an insane amount and interact with extremely bright individuals. Having Google on your resume opens A LOT of doors. Wildly disorganized to the point where your team, product + general efficiency suffers.So you remain frustrated. HR treats employees extremely poorly. Very difficult to get promoted. Absolutely no work-life balance whatsoever. I thought this was the dream, but was very disappointed in my experience at Google.	0.13390309964276537	0.2722764216562645	0.202834551443985	0.21426011381669743	0.17672581344028784
IS&T has changed and for GOOD !!! I have been working in IS&T just over an year. When I joined the company I was pretty skeptical about this Apple wing following the reviews about it before but after the first year I am pretty darn proud to have actually joined it.  The people I work with are top performers and all ENGINEERS. We have the highest engineering strength in the IS&T Org. which was not the case a few years back. This has improved both employee motivation and deliverables. IS&T is now more engineering focussed than ever which is evident from the number of Apple employees in the team now.  ... and the compensation is one thing at start that you expect good from company like Apple but to get an year end stock bonus, cash bonus and salary increase and all together is just top notch. Also earlier in the year all employees got BEATS headphones in the annual  Working hours are fine too, yes ! you work hard at times but thats just part of dev cycle. Nothing out of ordinary. No freebies, No Free Food - Yes we do get small parties here and there but I think Apple expects to spend out of your pocket to cover for it.

You will burn out Great experience for further down the road. Amazon on the resume really does open up some doors. There are also some great people to work with. Pay was top notch and hard for other companies to match. Despite the promises at the hiring event that Amazon was kinder and gentler, it really depends on who your General Manager is. My first building was great and everything I wanted. Then I got promoted and my second building was decidedly less so. When the encouragement turned into veiled threats it was time to go. As I am finding out now, by talking to HR people at other companies, everyone leaves Amazon for a reason.	0.18703550104586758	0.21271464406647297	0.201471004948745	0.21251189822772848	0.1862669517111859

Premier Field Engineer - Services - Data & AI domain Benefits are possibly the best in the industry, depending on what state you reside in you may pay nothing (per paycheck, not co-pays) for medical benefits, dental and vision are spectacular as well (they even cover adult orthodontia). 401k match is great, stock grants (not options) are like a carrot on a string but when they vest it is great, expect these grants in lieu of substantial salary raises or bonuses...ymmv Company is very set on becoming diverse company embracing all cultures and personality, unsure how well or how measured this is.

Customer Obsessed, Disposable Employees You can learn a great deal about standing up AWS cloud based services, running various random agile dev methodologies, leading young teams of 5-8 devs and shipping software on a very fast basis. The systems for deploying services and the number of services deployed services are amazing. If you negotiate really hard on the way in, you can get almost $160K + a similar amount in monthly signing bonuses and/or stock grant for four years upon accepting. Just wait though, the catches to this Faustian bargain are baked into the culture -- it will get you. Your odds of getting hired from an interview are about 1 in 10. Nobody ever gets more than $160K to start as that is the salary cap. While the year 1 and 2 signing bonuses can be nearly that much each, years three and four are entirely stock grants, while year five just base salary. The average tenure at Amazon is 12 months -- more than half do not make it to 1 year. Stack ranking (grading on the curve) guarantees purging of the ranks periodically. If you have a live service, you and your team are going to be on-call frequently and will have to carry a pager to you can provide day/night instant support. Most of the people in the South Lake Union offices are professional technical, and very annoyingly politically correct Seattleites with self-righteous liberal attitudes. Some parts of the company have HORRIBLE senior management that practices random public humiliation of attendees. Plus, you will likely be doing weeks long self-abasing "correction of error" documents anytime there is a problem with your software services. The Amazon Leadership principles generally seem like sound business practices, but make no mistake, you MUST drink the kool-aid and live every one of them or else. The employee culture is oppressive and soul crushing by design. Probably the worst part of Amazon culture is the unrelenting moral superiority of their practices. They actually believe they are "all that" in terms of software methodologies and that their rivals like Google, Apple, Microsoft, etc. know nothing about software and can teach them nothing of value -- it verges on insufferable, myopic arrogance.	0.09529050322055921	0.31320289430633463	0.2436022511271492	0.1913029041927897	0.1566014471531674

(Xbox) Dissapointing Microsoft pays well, offers a lot of perks, and great benefits. Working OT (late nights, weekends) is basically required.

Amount of office politics and favoritism is downright ridiculous.  They encourage "transparency" but the moment you speak out too much or to the wrong person, you automatically have a bullseye on you. Yes, people are often let go all the time with very little context or insight.  Netflix culture stresses "stunning colleagues" but in reality, it's a very superficial environment where people who suck up to the right people or "SAY YES" types are the only ones who do well.

They take care of you Microsoft does a great job of taking care of their employees. It's clear that they value them and give as much as they reasonably can give to them given how large they are and how they're always under the microscope with investors. The company is massive which makes it very hard to have significant influence on the product you're working on. Smaller projects are great there, but are often cancelled before they prove themselves. You basically have to give up caring about your product and only care about your career.	0.1824790964016744	0.20753266531541922	0.2209241098471685	0.20733485860361095	0.1817292698321269

Jobs in Redmond/Bellevue are great, awesome opportunities. Stay away from Bay Area MSFT. Super smart people, driven, and big thinkers. When you're in Redmond where I spent over 10 years, you have great opportunity, collaboration, and camaraderie.

Very good A great company to work for, you are given the training needed to do the job and the rest is up to you. The compensation is very competitive. Some of the challenges of working at Amazon are some colleagues with very bad attitudes, they approach you in a rude and demeaning manner and that personally makes working at Amazon very challenging.

Amazing Place to be at Round the clock facilities for almost anything you require. You will not be able to adjust to the work environments of other companies after enjoying the facilities here. All employees are very helpful and cheerful. As an intern you will not be discriminated or left alone, you have opportunities to go out and meet other teams in the department and get along with your team during team outings, lunches and games throughout the week. Some teams have rigorous meetings and scrums 3 times a week with needing a new solution every meeting, but not necessarily. If you can get used to a similar routine way of working in the IT industry then this is the best place. If you are interested in more of interactive work any IT company is not recommended for that case.	0.1717469145098303	0.19424524850894412	0.21851065368990455	0.20892838180670942	0.2065688014846117

My Favorite Place to Work No two days at Amazon have been the same for me. Even when working on the same types of tasks, I've seen, learned, and done new and interesting work.  My management has always been customer focused. It's more than talk, they walk the talk.  The company is huge but there are always opportunities to do and learn new things.  My team is very helpful when I am stuck and answers questions without being judgmental.  An excellent health insurance plan.  I think I am compensated well. Though, other companies seem to have perks we don't.  I feel like I am making a difference in the world while, at the same time, making money. It's less of selling stuff and more of helping other people have the tools they need to improve their lives and livelihoods. I sometimes think I need a PhD to understand the PTO policies.  The same is true of the health insurance policies.  The standard-issue laptops leave little room for people that need bifocals to read.  There is a generous pet policy, new mothers have rooms, and there's a nice parental leave policy, but there's not much for family care beyond that. Bring dogs to work but leave your kids at home.  The commute (when I have to go into Seattle) is terrible. Some days it feels borderline criminal.  A leadership value of frugality is used to prevent the subsidation of things like membership at the Pro Club.	0.18017212407083372	0.16559289393159515	0.24489200640287215	0.26985339499222205	0.13948958060247701
Trying to change, but company culture still holding it back its potential Finally awakening to consumer needs and how to build them on the machine learning and Bing knowledge platforms. Has the cash and international presence to succeed. Promotions almost impossible to get. Good managers not valued. Recent changes to review system are a mess, e.g., your typical manager still doesn't have a clue about your 'relative contributions' and definitely has little or no influence in compensation or promotion -- compensation still done by senior leadership behind closed-doors as before.	0.19026841952804419	0.20011028999400132	0.20865087955230566	0.21973160641556722	0.18123880451008173

Great work culture, exciting new time Microsoft has been going through somewhat of a culture transformation for the past 2-3 years. Satya Nadella has taken some great steps in positioning the company for a bright future, such as focusing on the cloud, opening up the Office eco-system to work on all platforms etc. The market has reacted well, with the stock price steadily rising up. The culture and attributes can depend very heavily on the group one works in, since Microsoft is such a huge company. The positive experience I have had may not reflect across all business units.	0.1906437760097139	0.20624813108406687	0.207849985051122	0.20331152345826442	0.19194658439683268
Dump the orlando site management I really liked working with smart, creative and motivated engineers. I felt like the first level engineers all worked together very well and got a tremendous amount of work done in an incredibly short time. I'm missing working with them. It will be a good career memory. Pay and benefits are excellent. I also enjoy the whole Orlando area. Now the problem. Management is the worst! Everything I was enjoying about working at the Orlando site was ruined by these corrupt politicians. First of all, being a manager at Apple makes them feel as if they are the best on the planet. This translates into extreme arrogance and failure to listen to anything any engineer says. They are not good managers. They just think so and demand to be treated like they are great. Forget about anyone listening to your ideas and expect to be talked down to all the time. Next, and I think worst, there is such a strong desire by management to retain their jobs, and hopefully advance their careers, at a company name like Apple that they will do anything to make themselves look even greater than they act like they are. So you will always fail to get a manager to listen to your explanation that an idea is bad. Then some story will be created to blame you when that bad idea actually goes bad because managers cannot be held accountable for their mistakes. This was a very corrosive work environment. I realized that instead of a chance to make a real difference, my career would only be one of being ignored, worked to death, and blamed for every bad move a manager made. I was paid well. But not well enough to put up with such undeserved abuse. I voluntarily resigned when I had enough.	0.3174642312523641	0.09947212579240736	0.22613890445373877	0.22222496187665486	0.13469977662483493

Good for a few years, but don't stay too long - Salary - Benefits - Connector shuttle - Bad for personal brand if you stay more than 10 years. Many recruiters tend to pigeonhole individuals who have stayed 10+ years as having the "Microsoft mentality" - arrogant, stuck doing things the "Microsoft way," not a team player, requiring out-sized salary.  - Some roles very undervalued relative to the developer role (for example, marketing, content publishing, IT support). These roles tend to rely much more heavily on temp staffing.  - Highly political, too many meetings, mid-level managers, bureaucracy	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375

Great compensation if you can cut it Great benefits and compensation. Lots of different technologies to work on, lots of opportunities for visibility and impact. Good place to learn and explore mobile, full stack and backend infrastructure. Fun place to work when things are going well. High stress, lot of turnover. I've had a new manager every year. Some teams have a 24/7 work expectation. Highly competitive, and you are competing with lots of smart people. Seems very difficult to get a promotion and junior people who don't rise fast enough are pushed out. For senior engineers, one bad project or not enough impact and it can be very difficult to course-correct.	0.1772775758283723	0.20161699908538597	0.21181998282455544	0.212638935737763	0.19664650652392346

Overall Great Place to Work - Tons of opportunity for advancement, you can apply for new positions or be promoted after 90 days. - Benefits and pay are good - Great team atmosphere, everyone generally gets along very well - Communication between management in the office and out on the floor is lacking, leaves a lot of confusion, especially during peak. - Long hours, difficult to have a positive work/life balance	0.15276678715783523	0.23072653538483787	0.19867915404386782	0.2234465553087959	0.1943809681046633
Good money, for workaholics Great total compensation package, long term incentive program is generous. Lots of opportunity to travel and advance (if you are willing to relocate). The people they employ are dedicated and intensely smart. Growing at a ridiculous rate means job security as long as you perform! Fast, roller coaster, high intensity pace means tensions usually run high. Planning is difficult. Most of time is spent "putting out fires". Offer letters are basically contracts, read carefully. No tuition or certification reimbursement for management level employees, failure to invest in developing leadership is a shame for a large technology company that can afford to. Turnover rate is atrocious, I don't know anyone who didn't have more than five managers over the span of a year or so. Treated employees like workhorses, was expected to be "plugged in" 24/7. Company growth was too big for our dept resources to keep up with! Hope your experience is different!	0.238833128983893	0.17213989714858358	0.15763116143826297	0.2350380418662826	0.1963577705629779

It's not for everyone. Strong sense of ownership and autonomy within your teams. No overbearing tooling requirements "use whatever tool you think suits the problem best". Very intelligent peers working on difficult problems at huge scales. Part of the strong sense of ownership is the expectation that you will put the company's needs above your personal life in certain situations. Obviously for some people this isn't a con, and working long hours on interesting problems is fine, even ideal.

Used to be a fun job, but that changed drastically. Job security: In this economy, job security is a precious commodity. If you can get hired on full time, you have to try hard to get fired. Production quota seems hard to meet at first, but once you're familiar with the process it gets much easier to make rate. Their attendance policy is hands-down the most lenient I've ever seen. Because they use an attendance points system, if you manage it right, you can come and go as you please. If you want to leave early or take a day off simply because you feel like it, you can do that without any retribution.  Benefits: The health insurance is mediocre, but all other benefits are far better. You get free life insurance, free accidental death and dismemberment insurance, free short term/long term disability insurance (which saved my bacon when I was out on medical leave), tuition reimbursement, and $1200 worth of stocks each year.  Co-workers: I've met a lot of great people during my five years at Amazon. You'll have no trouble making new friends.  As a business I have a great deal of respect for Amazon. I've met Jeff Bezos. He's a good guy. A few years ago, he visited our facility for a few days and spent a full shift working in a process. That says something about the man who signs our paychecks. Unfortunately, though I respect Amazon a great deal, I don't think Bezos has any idea what really happens on the floor of his fulfillment centers. So here's a breakdown:  Moral: The atmosphere has become extremely negative. We used to be encouraged to talk to our co-workers while on the floor (as long as we stayed productive), because it was good for morale. As morale was boosted, so was productivity. Now, the attitude is if you're talking, you're not working hard enough. If we don't keep our head down, eyes front, and mouths closed, we get "coached" about work ethic. We also used to be encouraged to give feedback to our managers. Managers called it an "open door policy." After all, there is no better expert of a particular process than the people doing it all day. That philosophy worked, too. But that changed. Now everything's micromanaged by middle management, and any feedback, no matter how constructive, is treated like an attitude problem.  Workload: At first glance, the work doesn't seem hard. But that's deceptive. Labor hours have been reduced to a skeleton crew. Few people in certain roles are pushed past their physical limit, resulting in injuries. And if you get hurt on the job, they report it as a non work related injury, even though it isn't. Thus, not only are you disqualified from Workman's Comp, but they can also fire you, and keep saying on record how safe they are.  Pay: They say competitive pay, but they don't tell you that they're comparing you with general retail jobs such as JCPenny, Sears, and Wal-Mart, although it's a warehouse job. They don't compare our pay to other warehouse jobs or distribution centers (ie. Meijer Distribution, CostCo, etc.) because they're all union jobs with excellent pay.  Opportunity for growth: If you aren't a military officer, there is no opportunity for growth. There is one promotion you can earn, after that, that's it. Area managers and above are hired from outside, usually from the military, and anyone applying for a promotion are told they're not qualified, in spite of their degrees, years of experience, and expertise of the process. They tell you what you need, only to move the goal post the next time you apply.  Work-life balance: There is none. It's that simple. I come home from a ten (sometimes twelve) hour shift too tired to eat dinner. That's not an exaggeration. My daily life is: get up, go to work, come home, pass out on top of my covers on my bed with my clothes still on. Sometimes, I have to settle for the couch, as the stairs prove too much of an obstacle. That's not a rant, my roommate made fun of me about that the other day.  All in all, after five years there, I'm pretty miserable. It's a good short term job, especially during the holiday season, but don't make a career out of it.	0.13611365209072246	0.157301787095978	0.33232485671446915	0.18594097115964764	0.18831873293918272

It looks good on your resume. -Nice, decent pay.  -Call center experience  -Basic knowledge of how to troubleshoot Apple products.  -Comfortable environment.  -Even if you don't stay long at least it makes your resume look stronger in the long run.  -Good vacation time. -Misleading concepts, poor positioning, terrible articles, and lies. When I went from iOS to Mac+ I was promised a raise. In time I learned that it was based upon performance not accepting the position. Now I'm doing double the work without a pay increase. Thanks a lot Apple.  -Good trainers, poor training methods by Apple. They have this "Sesame Street" mindset as if we're back in preschool. They stick you in a classroom for 2-3 weeks and only provides the basics rather than the biggest call drivers. It's no wonder why customers become so frustrated in waiting 15 minutes for the most simple answers.  -The majority of Senior Advisors rarely wants to take over the call. They try to put it all on you. Bottom line: it's an "inside vacation" to them.  -In order to gain an opportunity you have to be cool with management and become their lapdog.  -Some team leaders barely want to help and prefer to gossip about people and their personal lives. They even become jealous when you're able to help your peers in a way that they never knew.  -Customers are rude, nasty, and impatient(especially the older folks).

I've matured and developed many skills with this company. There is a strong commitment to personal development and career experiences to help you focus on particular competencies. There is also a substantial health plan and many incentives for full timers. At its core, this is still retail and the hours can be brutal when you have a young family or other obligations outside the store. Also, there is very little chance of moving from retail to corporate if you're looking for new challenges.	0.1757954378181142	0.21217442940820114	0.20738375636341294	0.21413986862696965	0.19050650778330205

Customer and people obsessed During the recruitment process, I was surprised on how friendly and people focused the company was. I felt right at home and treated with the utmost respect and interest. After being through the somewhat peculiar (and very exhaustive) recruiting process I am more than pleased to see that this has continued on "the inside". AWS is a very humane and people centric company. They are customer obsessed in the true meaning of the word, it's not just a slogan. The mind the competition, but they don't obsess about them. It's all about doing right by the customer. The company culture is very much alive and they strive for excellence while maintaining the ability to serve customers by being agile and forthcoming. Development opportunities within the company are huge. You are expected to move around, share your expertise, dive into new areas, and grow as an individual and a contributor to future success. There seems to be no end to the possibilities.  I would really recommend to look for a job with AWS if you want to be at the forefront of technology, are customer obsessed, while maintaining a good work life balance. It's a place where I can feel good about the work I do. Being the leader on cloud computing and at the same time behaving like a startup has both advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes it feels like we're inventing the wheel all over again. But sometimes the lack of mature processes is giving us the edge to move quickly. There is not super much structure so if you are looking for that you may be disappointed.	0.21788320306536557	0.17793794917004815	0.18376911822644507	0.24295464235424272	0.17745508718389855

People are smart Decisions making is typically very rationalized -- this could be a pro or con depending your view. If you like IPhone, probalby you won't like this company since it focus on more 'real' value.  You will learn how to 'collaborate' -- collaboration is one of most important part of work at Microsoft. In my experience most people are 'collaborative' but it could be super challenging when cross team boundary as there is limited incentive for a team to put other's priority higher than itself. You have to cope with review model which some ratio of employees will be marked as 'underperformed' (the model changes over time, but there always will be some of us get into this category) which is bloody and choosing a good boss is more than important.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

One of the best retail experiences, though YMMV depending on the store managers. You get to play with and talk about some of the best technology on the planet. You can also be the catalyst for teachers, entrepreneurs, students, etc. to use said technology to enrich their lives and that of others. Depending on management, you may have very little time to train and continue your learning. Burnout from constant work activity is common.

20 Years at Microsoft When I joined Microsoft in 1992, it was one of the most innovative companies in the world. Lots of fascinating work with very talented people who had a very strong drive for results. I was extremely well compensated with stock options, stock grants, salary and bonus. I created 8 new products and was awarded 36 patents that generated over $2 billion in verifiable incremental revenue for Microsoft. Microsoft's strategy and focus were much clearer in the early 1990s. Opportunities for personal growth existed everywhere. Today there are fewer opportunities today for people who want to be major contributors. Some of this is part of becoming a larger company and reaching the end of the PC era, but much of it is risk aversion. The PC era is ending. A new era is also beginning. This is opportunity. If you want to be great you have to take chances. I am all for mitigating as much risk as possible. However, you will get the same outcome if you keep using the same old strategies.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Read and believe the negative reviews. I aged ten years in one year... avoid at all costs!!! Working for Amazon is great for the CV and if you can manage to stick it out for a year you will feel that you have performed a miracle. Most people don't last that long. Amazon truly did have the smartest people I have ever worked with, sadly with very little 'social intelligence' or any life outside of work, no time to exercise, socialise, holiday... makes you wonder how smart they really are? Amazon's long strategy to be the worlds most customer centric company is great, but only if you are a shareholder or customer. Employees are chewed up, exhausted and spat out before being replaced with a fresh MBA grad with fat loan repayments to keep up & no exposure to working for a decent company who think that the way people in this company behave is normal - it is not. Every single employee in Amazon is overworked and people are generally too busy to spend time with family, friends, exercise and have interests outside of work, let alone look up from their screens to acknowledge co-workers coming or going. Most workers eat lunch at their desk as they are too busy for a break. The majority of employees would not dream of leaving the office before 7pm, if you do this then your lack of commitment to Jeff's cause will be noticed. If offered one, don't take a blackberry or you will never get away from the madness. People who get on at Amazon are aggressive, know it all, blame culture workaholics, who will shift the blame on anyone but themselves and tear you to pieces as soon as anything goes wrong. Everything is a 'fire-drill' with people panicking and looking to apportion blame. You either have to adopt some of this negative behaviour yourself or you will become mincemeat. This kind of attitude would you get you nowhere in the real world but for some reason it is tolerated and encouraged at Amazon, just make you sure you unlearn this terrible workplace behaviour as quickly as possible once you have escaped. I saw at least 4 people 'disappear' during my time at Amazon, including someone who had relocated from abroad to work in Luxemburg who was fired in the most undignified manner. Employees who relocate and decide to leave of their own accord will be chased to repay relocation expenses. During an all hands meeting management sang the praises of people who had exceptional commitment to Amazon, one such person was specifically mentioned in front of the audience as a hero for still working from their laptop on an important project while next to the hospital bedside of their very sick child. This said it all, 'Amazon is more important than you, your health, your family and everything in your life'. Truly unbelievable and sickened me to the core. Don't be blinded by the RSUs (stock options), most people don't last here longer than a year. I heard internally that only 7% of people get the 4th year RSU pay out so you better be REALLY happy with your base salary and uncompetitive benefits package, 0% training budget and 0% chance of a pay rise during your time with Amazon. Also don't forget that you will be working double the hours of a regular job and that combined with the fact that the cost of living is extremely high in Luxembourg means your hourly rate will be peanuts. I read the negative reviews before joining Amazon and thought that 'it could not be THAT bad'!?. IT IS and more, so don't make the same mistake!!	0.08604131607642114	0.1546765728086469	0.20319361649685902	0.3029745470717405	0.2531139475463325

Lots of room to grow and lots of opportunity (if you look). Visibility - top down, you see everything. There are no secrets in this company. Very helpful if you know how to use this to your advantage. If you're not good, you won't survive here. If you have issues with your people skills, you won't survive here.

Starting from bottom to the top… Most of them were hired externally so they don’t live the Microsoft culture, don’t listen to feedback and clearly lie to you. People at the end of the chain love the company and what Satya is doing, they just totally disagree with what is going on in the management levels in Dublin. Turnover rate is increasing steadily and of course good people leave, lazy unqualified people stay. - Level and salary: When you join Microsoft you will find a career level in your profile which is important for your future development (every hiring manager asks for your level). Unfortunately levels are inconsistent and it seems like they randomly give you a level…it has nothing to do with your experience. Thanks to this the recruiting ruined several careers of the people here. The salary is also linked to levels so there automatically is a huge unfairness between people. It is quite obvious that people who started earlier are paid less. Leadership team knows about it but does nothing! - Targets/KPI: absolutely intransparent and when it comes to your yearly performance review you get a random rating because your manager has no clue anyway. Cheers!	0.18275329393788636	0.1578719070523636	0.24887157245333622	0.2743204934352408	0.13618273312117302

Great company, depending on team Great, smart, friendly people. Benefits are great, software and hardware provided is very decent. Better than average work-life balance. You need to interview to switch teams, and your manager might get upset if you do and enter negative feedback about you. Also, the company seems to follow other innovators these days (in several areas) instead of leading.	0.18620238632430228	0.213160642779645	0.20300774577617195	0.22123228351916607	0.17639694160071473
random review flexible schedule, zero supervision, the ability to do pretty much whatever you want without somebody breathing down your neck. If you want a job where nobody cares about the work you do, then this company is for you! One of the most disorganized and messed-up companies I have ever worked for. Communication is a joke! The on-boarding can take months -- even for the most base-level hourly grunt job. I've met my boss only once, and that was for 10 minutes. Working for Amazon is like working for a monster that will eventually lead to the biggest depression this country has ever seen.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Cool culture with low work-life balance. Really nice work-culture. Amazon is friendly place. With better work-life ballance, i can imagine that i would work there for many years. Very little work life balance. As a manager you are under constant stress as everything what you do is measured. Very little opportunities for long-term projects.

Mind-expanding. I was a Specialist on the Sales Floor of a very busy and tiny Apple Store. Learning curve was tremendous and challenging and completely outrageously fun. I was being paid to know every wonderful thing about Apple products and services and to share my enthusiasm with interested consumers. Perks were few and far between but appreciated nonetheless. No promotion sought, was a part-timer. Compensation, pretty low. Weekends and nights and holiday drudgery for Apple Retail. 12 hour shifts Black Friday. Corporate did not appreciate Retail Employees enough. Blanket emails sent to every employee giving the 'entire' company off except Retail was unappreciated.	0.19615277570132197	0.20629902180342832	0.19460166731239728	0.21610262983259051	0.18684390535026185

You must be self-motivated to succeed, the Amazon culture is not for everyone. If you need constant hand-holding and support, this company is not for you. As Amazon continues to grow at a rapid pace, the company is continuously redefining its management structure and philosophy, therefore, there are pockets of bad management.

Awesome company to work for Work life balance? Yes, you got it. You can find it at this high tech company! They even have a mother's room for you to feed your little baby. There was on-site washer and dryer. An employee got transferred from NY to MV HQ and didn't got out for a month, just living on Google campus! A lot of young and bright minds to work with, they will absolutely inspire you! The food is awesome and you will gain the infamous Google 15-30 lbs! The problem you are working to solve is instantly used by billions of people. How exciting that is!!! Very little supervision, some times, new hires do not know what not to do. Maybe that's the way to encourage and cultivate creativity!	0.19237806365950438	0.23658832968541652	0.17931448189418805	0.23441473665460508	0.15730438810628594

Ok, experience neutral. They pay $3000 a rolling year for college after a year of employment. Many, they should pay more to tier 1 and 3 even though it's general labor(picking,packing). Management gets over payed by 10's of thousands major money and under worked. They job isn't that difficult to deserve L4 starting at 85k total compensation in house and even more if they're recruited from a college.

Retail stores are a fun place to work. Lots of different personality types, where this can be good and bad... works out really well for Apple. They also had strong career paths built into working even the lower end/part time jobs.

Specialist Great discounts - not just on Apple products. Made friends - attracts similar people, generally good attitudes within the store. Cool factor Paid well Learned a lot Time off was unpaid. Scheduling was always an issue. No sick time - attendance policy is strict. Customers can be crazy - spent 70% of my time resetting apple IDs. Pressure on the family room means trouble customers get punted to red zone. Leads to worse NPS. NPP didn't really have an effect.

Interesting place for junior software engineers There is a lot to learn for a junior software engineer at Microsoft. It's perfect place to learn about the full software development cycle. There are plenty smart and bright senior engineers to learn from. Benefits are good for people with families. It gets more and more difficult to learn any skill out of engineering domain after a few years. Top-to-bottom work assignments occupy most of the time. There is not a lot of city life in Redmond, Washington. There are a lot of choices for outdoor activities though.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

A stagnant company - More focused on its  Company name recognition - If you say you work at Microsoft, people know who the company is. Free access to Microsoft software. This is a company in a cultural free-fall.  Microsoft used to be its own worst critic - it helped improve its software by internally having high expectations. Now it is full of non-technologists (many are women who "don't understand technology, but are good at communicating, or "big picture people". So concerned about its image and its diversity - if you aren't gay or a particular race with some complaint, you're a minority.	0.2123792249508122	0.14424170967398425	0.23477680379237886	0.19293199992243582	0.21567026166038888

HR has problems keeping accurate records Good for college students or a second job. Management is mostly friendly. Easy work if you're physically fit. If you're not physically fit keep at it and you will be. Skip the gym membership and work in an Amazon warehouse. HR has issues keeping accurate records of employee hours worked. Upper management has had to change dates HR messed up my attendance record saying I was absent when that was not the case. Also it doesn't matter how hard you work you are not rewarded. If you give 120% one day they expect that of you from then on. I was hired as a sortation associate and worked hard and did a lot of heavy lifting of boxes and helped others in their tasks without being asked or assigned to help coworkers. I did this for the first few months of my employment here. I even signed up double shifts during Thanksgiving and Christmas season. Because of my efforts I was assigned other duties in addition of my original duties but never received a raise. I've done inbound, sorting and scanning packages, water spider, staging, and cleanup sometimes all in the same day. I was given more to do and improved my work performance but was never given a raise so I stopped being great and just did the bare minimum of my job description which is to sort packages. Lesson learned, Amazon will pay employees the same if they are mediocre or great so don't waste energy trying to be great at Amazon. I have another job that rewards me for my extra efforts so I put my extra energy at my second job not at Amazon. The loss is Amazon's. In summary working for Amazon is a dead end job and it's not really worth it. Amazon pays warehouse employees on par what other companies pay their janitors in the area. I'm actively looking for employment elsewhere to take Amazon's spot on my work schedule and as soon as I'm hired by another company I'm gone.	0.15247242107305758	0.19361631517413583	0.2049262011649938	0.24328685542278913	0.20569820716502374

Great company Google offer an amazing work environment, with unbelievable perks. People around you are very smart  Whatever you do in Google, you are probably working on (or supporting) an innovative product and having a quite large impact.  Things move at a very fast pace. The speed is really one of a startup. Organized chaos is how I should describe Google. A chaos that magically works  It is a relatively flat organization. While there is a well defined chain of command in every function, the individual are still empowered to work cross-functionally and take initiative. It is getting a little bit too political in Google, which I guess is only natural for 40K company.  PMs tend to take a bit too much credit for everything around, Engineering are very isolated (maybe by design) from operation/monetization aspects. Other functions are secondary to PM and Engineering in almost every aspect.  Vision is increasingly a top-down thing with less and less grass root initiatives .......... working on your 20% these days mean your bonus will probably disappear because you need your manager sign-off, which likely has a different agenda, and his own 20%	0.1745438860471316	0.197408614982724	0.19295133832952635	0.225163298381489	0.20993286225912902

People - Someone rightly said, company is made with people. 4. Internal job opportunities - you name the role you want to do and there should be something within company. 1. Sometimes the work we do becomes monotonous. We need to take care of same (discussing with manager about the RnR) 2. Changing roles is still bit difficult.	0.18797236583165922	0.20335806371278978	0.20493747158125772	0.21447518035553462	0.18925691851875856

Non stop You work with some really great engineers on tight schedules that force you to figure out the most effective use of your time and the skills of the people you work with.

Better than going to college. Great environment. The people you work with at Apple are some of the top people in their fields. You meet extreme use of collaboration amongst teammates and others outiside of your team.  Training is amazing. They really want their employees to excel and give them the right tools to do so. The key is taking he initiative to want to learn and improve.  I leaned more about business and marketing than I did in my two colleges that I attended. Work/life balance is hard. Because Apple always excels to be the best at things, they really push their employees. Sometimes to the point where working overtime or stress levels start to rise.  It used to be that getting promoted was easy when I first worked there. Then after the iPhone Apple grew so big. Apple tries to promote from within but it is extremely competitive compared to the past to get an open position.	0.2124950636935658	0.21529081943011485	0.1808666692989003	0.196822077438946	0.19452537013847307

Serious issues happening within The benefits maybe better than some companies. Serious discrimination and conducts issues happening within. HR and management cover up for the managers they like. Few years back when HR changed the employees performance appraisal, managers use the new appraisal to mark down / disclaim the older staffs. If is only 1 or 2 managers with similar act against employees they wanted to get rid, it could be the managers' problem. When managers treating the employees happening across different departments, is there some form of "encouragement" to such acts from certain authority level?  There is no check against any disclaim or mark down by HR unless employee raises it up. Some manager allow supervisor to put in impossible goals in employees' appraisal with manager signed off. Funny thing is when the employee raise to the manager, manager agreed that is not a fair deal. Apple promotion could sometimes be about favoritism and racial more than capabilities.  When manager breach of conducts and deny the violation to HR with "I don't remember I said that.", manager wins the case. HR closed it and leave it to the manager handle with the employee. Little does HR knew the manager told the employee, "I may have said that.", "I could be pointing to another employee not you." when she tried to brush the case off. So what happen if employees are allow to obtain the evidence with their own means and put it up in the internet. Only then employee gets a fair case? This particular manager took more than one conduct case into her own hands "forcing" another employee to leave due to certain type of citizenship / race both employees are holding. On the base, she encourages gang bully within her team to help her eliminate those she dislikes.  Same thing happen when an cross team lead (formerly was Apple online store call agent) and few others existing call center agents make profit out of Apple products under the employees discount plan via cash transactions. Conduct team closed eyes on the purchase even the case was raised anonymously. Such cases can be easily found in the company records. Relevant team also has the means to proof it without the need to know is a cash transaction yet not identify the violation.	0.24330749730634443	0.15587792144725843	0.15797773789249797	0.30532770277624954	0.13750914057764976

Extras: Lots of free Amazon gear, volunteer opportunities, occasional fun programs such as themed trivia days, grill-outs, catered meals every day during the busy months. While metrics/goals for Seller Support seemed to be fair at first, much of it is beyond control.

Employees are customers too Jeff Very strong brand name, Amazon continues to innovate and its exciting to be part of a business that continues to grow quickly, and to be reinvesting in the business and releasing new products. I can honestly say that I have worked with the smartest people in my career at Amazon, which encourages me to raise my game. Strong leadership principles that provide clarity on how to get things done in the business. A word of warning if you are a parent or have obligations away from the work place that you need/would like to also find time for. Amazon expects your full commitment- there are many reviews on here of people calling out appalling work/life balance- so pay heed to these. There have been so many instances I have seen of employees on sick leave through stress and anxiety, with little attention paid to why and to integrate these back into the business or provide the appropriate support. Amazon is a burn out mill that requires your full focus, so perfect for those who need validation in their lives from a work perspective, but awful for those who don't. Very frugal environment with extremely lean teams- pretty typical for most individuals to be doing 2 roles at once. Business continues to grow but is an increasing concern that any revenues achieved through growth don't seem to feed back to the employee.  Senior management attitude is to focus on things that go wrong- never any call outs for what has gone well. Depressing attitude to take in a business that demands so much from employees. Amazon gets data, doesn't get people or how to encourage a positive collegiate culture. Lots of new naive MBA's that the business can suck dry. Very high turnover of staff- people leave/disappear and are never heard of again.  The only people I would recommend Amazon to are those who are willing to completely throw themselves 100% into their career for a few years to get experience and the name on their CV- even then you need to be very careful about what you take on board- the business will suck the life out of you if you let it.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

If you want to learn new skills, please think 100 times before you take job in Microsoft. Great Benefits overall: Medical, Dental, Vision Benefits, Stay Fit Program, 401K 50% contribution from employer, 10 Paid Holidays, Great 5 months of Paternity/Maternity leave for dad/mom. Location is not extremely crowded like Seattle, There are still few great people work in Microsoft. 1. First level and second level manager in Microsofts are the root cause of Microsoft moving very slow and not innovating. These managers are rigid (been there for 10+ years, no more technical, don't understand current trends and they are still decision maker). These people still holds huge power and take all shortcuts and easy and quick things to get quick personal gain/growth. This attitude has hurt Microsoft since last 15 years. 2. Review System is extremely horrible because stack ranking still happens as of 2016. Though they don't communicate to employees, but HR and Manager maintains Stack ranking and probably curve too. Stack ranking is so horrible that manager who has great sales power takes advantage of situation and manager who are technical but not good in sale looses their employee being rated down. So it is extremely important to report to best manager who is best of his manager, if you want to succeed in Microsoft.	0.17990953070323804	0.24373394691318107	0.15215407630599226	0.2317695897263872	0.19243285635120144

Great benefits, good compensation, increasingly bogged down by size and legacy. On the right team, good work-life balance is possible. Compensation is very good, but you won't get rich from the stock any more. Benefits aren't quite as good as they used to be, but still better than what is offered by most companies. As the products get older, and the number of employees and kingdoms grow, it gets harder to build products and features that people actually want. Instead, much of what happens is driven by people focusing on how to survive the next stack-ranked review, via self-promotion, over building great software.	0.18625737790151667	0.21182968807274483	0.19301097917196336	0.22340992889381658	0.18549202595995845

A great place to work, but you have to be strong Fantastic technical challenges, brilliant people, complex and important problems to be solved. The benefits are great, of course, and the prestige both during the time you work there and even afterwards on your resume are significant benefits. If you like serious intellectual challenges, and the opportunity to do something that makes a difference in the world, this is the place for you. I think the compensation was very fair compared to other companies, and those people who really are rock stars really get very well compensated. The culture (in engineering) is a tough one, hard on people who aren't at the top of their game. I think that Apple actually is a pretty high integrity place in general, but in my experience there certainly used to be a very strong political nature. This is always true in any organization with a lot of people, of course, but at Apple there was a certain sloppiness about allowing bad managers without a strategic plan to continue to survive and do damage far too long just because they were good at making their bosses feel good. Maybe this was just the case in the group where I worked. Maybe this has changed since Tim Cook has taken over.	0.14672009087518967	0.1863117484286361	0.2479162457773825	0.2504728208121777	0.168579094106614

one of best places to innovate There is a reason why Amazon is regarded as one of the most innovative companies in the industry. The company has a well-defined process for new ideas to be reviewed by the right group of people, and adopted based on their merits, with least amount of bureaucracy during the process. The company's SDE job titles are generally one-level lower than the industry. It is fairly common for a senior SDE from other top tech companies to take an SDE-2 position at Amazon, which is a bummer to many.	0.17745391953659131	0.20069985418747313	0.22577157830428962	0.21587089561318415	0.18020375235846192

Good place to work if you need a job that pays well They give everyone a chance. They don't discriminate based on age, race or gender. Lots of opportunity get overtime especially during the holidays. Lots of Unpaid time off Very Little Work Life Balance You will find yourself working 50-60 per week when holidays come around and during "Peak" season. And because you are working during the holidays, you won't be able to spend time with your family.  Hard to earn Vacation Days  They also don't provide much training to managers. They believe in throwing people in the fire and letting them figure out on their own how to put it out.	0.14651460379729223	0.1805250885413661	0.1892308080443376	0.2652237662880549	0.21850573332894935

Terrible experience Google is an amazing company. Innovative, passionate, insisting and investing to stay young, and continuously trying to improve Google sucks when it comes to bringing on board new talent with a strong and accomplished caliber and assisting its integration into the operations. Instead of making the younger and less experienced work-force absorb the experience and Know-How, Google embraced a weak and overly flat environment which allows the least experienced ones set the tone and fight off external Know-How and experience. That's not really a company that wants to change but rather a company that it suffers from massive turn-over in sales and business operations and instead of fighting it off with a confident infusion of experience operations leader, it created an overly flat and 'fuzzy' environment, where everyone is obsessed with trying to please others and be sweet on the expense of doing the right thing.	0.1745438860471316	0.197408614982724	0.19295133832952635	0.225163298381489	0.20993286225912902

I thought I had found the perfect job. Instead, all the negative rumors were true. You'll get a lot of work done - but you'll pay a steep price to do it. At L5 or above the pay package may be attractive. Beware of getting trapped in a scenario where you have to pay back a signing or relocation bonus. Many people are staying for that reason only. Constant emotional abuse from managers via email, 1:1 meetings, and in meetings with others. Example: A manager holding a meeting to rip apart two people in front of an audience of people who are not involved in the situation - then privately telling those same two people they're doing a great job. Poor managers with a limited skill set / understanding on how to motivate employees No respect for planned time off If you don't stop yourself, you will work 60+ hours a week VP level management supports abusive tactics within their divisions- getting results is applauded no matter what the cost VPs are complete jerks.

UN-believable!! I LOVE the work, it is physically challenging at times, but, it keeps me moving and, despite being exhausted and often sore, I always feel productive at the end of the day. My AM is also great, one of the VERY few exceptions to being a "straight out of college" hire who actually seems to have his head on straight! My ONLY problem is HR! They seem to be completely incompetent. It's, often, hard to contact live people, and none of them seem to know what any of the others are doing. They all have different ways of explaining or remedying situations, there is no uniform process and you can speak to several reps about the same issue and always get different and conflicting answers. In addition, it is often difficult, if not, in fact, impossible, to relate your issues to the representative on the other end due to high incident of language barriers or thick foreign accents! They should hire more competent, perhaps, older & more seasoned workers, AND they should develop more of a protocol...one that CLEARLY outlines the same procedure for ALL workers on ALL employee related topics (such as bereavement leave, etc). And, make sure that if you are an English speaking employee that you get and English speaking rep (without the heavy spanish, asian or middle eastern accents, PLEASE!)	0.22415169825828313	0.143605524696929	0.22638183962937095	0.24953102252588788	0.15632991488952905

Amazon in a nutshell Very good and comprehensive package, relocation (for the eligible employees), stock, private medical insurance Once Amazon employee you have to be ready for trade-offs in regards to work-life balance.

Enter the field to really know and play game. Field maybe rough, but team work always win. You can be yourself, have options to grow in different laterals, can meet different kind of people with variety of qualifications. Company honors your being self, don't discriminate based on dress or ethinicty, only the best among team succeed. Growth can be stagnant at times or departments. Some department liaise with NA and hence a different culture. Need to do the extra 10% above the 100 to get attention. Some departments do not prefer those from CS since they know too much.

A unique place to work... just not satisfying for me Top notch talent... I've never worked with such a collection of smart and passionate folks. Benefits are obviously among the best in the business. Tech support staff that's actually knowledgeable and responsive... stuff actually gets resolved quickly (may seem funny to harp on that but the point is... the company makes investments to make problems like this vanish) Definitely felt like a smaller fish in a big pond... not used to that. Although they've invested mightily in developer productivity, there are still a lot of impediments. Part of why I left was I didn't have faith/passion about the product strategy I was working within (won't say why I left). Bottom line is, I'm a very PRODUCT focused engineer, not a TECHNOLOGY focused engineer... I know that may seem odd but it's true. If you want to go to a place and grapple with technical challenges on scales you are unlikely to find elsewhere and are not easily frustrated by capricious product strategy this would be a great place for you!

Amazon Web Services and Work Life Balance Amazon Web Services is one of the best places in the industry to challenges your technical skills and grow as a software development engineers. AWS has an amazingly talented set of senior engineers who provide quality mentoring.  Despite what old reviews might say, you can, in fact have work life balance at Amazon. I have two children under the age of 5, my spouse works, and we have a life. Moreover, Amazonians are there to help you learn how to find that balance. If you are used to being the best, you won't be at AWS because many of the best of the best are there. Some people thrive this environment as they love learning from their peers.

Worst Place to Work in Design Scaled Service (DSS) Team - Amazon Bangalore You get to work in one of the world's fastest growing companies. This is a design team where managers think they can make their own rules. Even if there is national holiday or company declared list of mandatory holidays, managers do not respect it and they kind of pressurize employees to work on these days. There are list of optional holidays which employees have right to avail, but if employees take all of their(5 optional holidays allowed in a year) optional holidays, then they get negative impression/ feedback from managers.

From associate to manager Competitive environment, constant feedback from management, huge amounts of learning and experience gained in very short time frames. Moving up is very difficult, you're only looked at as a valued employee if you dedicate your life to the company. Most employees are seen as disposable, as there's plenty of talent to pull from. The "compensation package" which includes stock is a negative, as your standard pay check is rather petty for the work you do.

Wonderful company to work! But growth can be very manager/team dependent. You get to work with some of the best minds. The culture is one of best, very inclusive workplace attitude. Most people are warm and helpful. If you join the Hyderabad campus it is a vast and beautiful place and you'll love coming to the office. Salary is best in class. Very flexible timings. Various activities like Hackathons and Garage events to foster interest in new technologies. Outings and events are really nice as no corners are cut. Microsoft is a company which truly believes and invests in your physical and mental well-being through fitness plans and stuff. A lot of subscriptions and resources are provided free of cost to FTEs. Any con would be nitpicking, however, growth can be very manager and team dependent. Some teams work on legacy tech so if you join such a team you get stuck in debugging and maintaining legacy code and growth is also slow. Because it's such a huge company there can be frequent organizational shuffling which can create some confusion. And there are windows updates of course which you cannot turn off !! :P.	0.18309931587756523	0.22068432938841348	0.19855812374815335	0.20203527782406955	0.19562295316179829
A Management Nightmare Looks great on your resume. Lots of perks (if that's what moves you). Interesting story to tell your friends. If you're a manager, this place will drive you nuts. Employees are snarky, entitled, and disrespectful brats. They have no concept of critical thinking or any desire to do real work.  Unlimited sick days in the hands of overpaid children is impossible to manage, my team would somehow always manage to catch a "cold" on Fridays and Mondays. (Interesting that they would Tweet and post about their weekend party binges though.)  While Facebook does a great job recruiting Ivy League talent, I was underwhelmed by the level of intelligence of "Facebookers." They are so busy congratulating themselves on being "awesome" that they never stop to consider they didn't have any real world work experience to back that assertion up. It's really hard to manage and lead people who "know it all."  Kitchy inspirational posters everywhere you look. "Be Bold!" "Dare Greatly!" Yet, I didn't see any substantive work or product coming out of anyone, which makes sense since Facebook really is just a glorified website - users are the product.  Communication is an absolute nightmare. You are forced to "friend" everyone you work with and join an incessant amount of internal group pages where you had to filter through all the BS people would post (memes, YouTube videos, snarky hipster comments…clearly these people didn't have enough work to do) to get to any relevant work related information you needed to know for your job. I actually thought I was going to get dumber working there.  Meetings - the sheer volume was mind bending. None of them critical to doing actual work, more self congratulating on unearned awesomeness. Being social at Facebook was far more important than doing anything meaningful while you were there.  Anyone serious about doing meaningful work need not apply. You'll make it a few months and then quit out of frustration.	0.238192839440933	0.26198192567330697	0.18865187499535882	0.20794289571145613	0.103230464178945

Working at Amazon is great only if you are a right fit A fast paced company that you will not get bored in the first year. You get a chance to work with a group of talented peoples, to work on creative and big thinking projects and high impact initiatives. Overall a great experience to enhance your career growth and build up leadership skills. Amazon is a "customer centric" company only for end consumer, not for the employee or suppliers. You will have to prioritize your work over your top internal customers or your top suppliers, otherwise you will not survive. After one year, you will find yourself either repeat the similar activities and overloaded everyday with no hope, or find a ladder to move up or a path to exit. It is hard to make a true friend here since everybody is trying to find a way to bypass the heavy workload to get promote or survive. If you are a perfectionist that want to get everything done perfectly, this is not a place for you. You will not feel happy after work since you had to ignore the needs from so many not-that-important internal customers and external vendors	0.17685192084066773	0.1859998062379762	0.23466890786603334	0.2340203491661939	0.16845901588912884

mediocre middle mgmt who are too scared to do the right thing for the company. - Nice office space , free snack and drinks in pantry.  - Having first hand experience on the latest technology and software/tool  - Meeting many passionate and smart people under the same roof especially in support teams who genuinely wants to make a difference for the company.  - Flexibility to work from home / remotely with manager's approval  - The overall compensation package for FTEs is pretty competitive in today's market ( great insurance coverage + flexi cash + medical )  - Great exposure if one is looking for gain experience in a complex environment / working with multiple stakeholders. - Lack of clear direction from middle mgmt and leadership team. News cascaded down are usually late or over generalised, leaving it up to your own imagination/interpretation (because you are not high-level enough) to hear the real situation.  - Do not expect any kind mentorship on your own career growth. The middle mgmt managers are too caught up with their personal agenda and 'showing visibility' to their intended target audience trying secure their own jobs/ looking for next move. They have little interest in being mentors to their directs nor investing time to make their own team successful.  - Despite hiring all the highly qualified and skilled candidates, the management has little tolerance for alternative voice. The mid level managers generally expects 'Yes' man, no questions asked type of behaviour. They will also resort to petty and biased actions to get back at you for 'disobeying' them by giving you a negative testimonial/performance appraisal. period.  - The open secret is : How well you climb in this company is not truly dependant on your performance but how well you network and show your visibility to the right people. Quarter after quarter, it encourages people to form alliance to "scratch each other's back". Typically such alliance will come up with some random rubbish project that has no real impact to the business nor help to solve real customer issues. They use up a whole lot of resource from support teams to do all the dirty work for them and at the end of it, they get all the credits and praises for "leaning in"  - Many of the mid level managers are long timers ( >10 years) , they know the game so well hence they are too afraid to try or do anything different for fear of losing their jobs.  - Stack ranking. The performance review system is time consuming, a lengthy process and final evaluation is flawed & biased. Employees of the same BU & of the same ranks are pitted against each other. Only 10% will be the top performers and 20% will be average performers , leaving 70% of the entire crew falling into the lower trench. What's the point of making 70% of the crew feeling like they are failures in their job when they are not ?? Of course, MS have since embarked on new review system that is less time consuming but the methodology of grading the staff has not yet evolved - basically new skin but same crappy insides.	0.3349156291758487	0.1605541897413113	0.21091485197062879	0.15511881772355082	0.13849651138866015

Great Experience, Well Compensated I love working at Apple. The opportunities are second to none. You get to work on products that the whole world wants.

Not worth the pay... The environment is high energy and the people are very friendly. They have a lot of games and videos, as well as devices to occupy your free time. It is extremely DIFFICULT to get fired. Which means that if you do get fired then you SERIOUSLY and imaginably screwed up. Your base PAY as of 2014-2015, as you are contracted out and paid by 24/7 is at the most 12.00 an HOUR! I do not know how Glassdoor came up with $15.  You are verbally abused everyday by the customer. The technology and the Knowledge base can chance on you, so you need to be extremely adaptable.  If someone starts calling you names, you can not hang up and you can not make outbound calls.  You are held to metrics and those standards are extremely difficult to maintain unless you have been working in a call center for 5 years. If you do not perform you will be written up.  One of those metrics is your call back rate, handle time (less than 5 and 1/2 minutes) and DSAT's (less than 4%) which translates into 1 NO in the survey.  Attendance is non-negotiable. I was sick for 9 weeks (I had my voice for less than 25% of the time) and I even brought in a doctors note explaining my situation and I STILL got written up.  They have shift bids, which means that every 6 months you can bid for a new shift. If your metrics are mediocre or bad, then you will be moved to what every shift they give you. Most places try to put you in shift according to your requests and needs. This is not that place. You can bison your own shift...and possibly keep it. My call center lost half of their work force due to the previous shift bid. They said they were going to try and change it to make it more "fair", but when I left, they can completely removed my shift time.  They did NOT tell me about shift bids when they hired me.  If you try for CSR 2 and don't meet the standard by day 90, you will lose your job. You do not go back to CSR 1 or given another chance.  iF YOU want to TRADE, then the person you trade with has to be approved by your team lead and theirs...and vise versa. I switched shifts with someone else, I put up 3 people before I found someone acceptable. The shift took 3 months to process due to a lack of organization.  If you do not mind being a punching bag, emotionally and verbally...then this is the job for you!	0.15999254199131016	0.18111962245806373	0.17527835975849235	0.3331531944345808	0.15045628135755307

great retail position. retail transformation needs to go deeper As someone who was probably qualified to work in engineering, I was really surprised how much I learned on the job - it was a fun job. Met really amazing customers - had the freedom to spend up to an hour ensuring they got all the support they needed. Was able to rotate around and spot teach people 1-on-1 and got recognized by customers. one of my best experiences was sharing about the iPhone in the Apple Theater and really shifting customer mindsets - they have never heard anything so compelling! having to stand all the time was taxing on my back (admittedly this was retail). lack of more sophisticated benefits like personal development and career coaching from HR. I did not feel my immediate manager was in the position to help me fully explore all the possibilities that were available to me at Apple outside of retail.	0.2124950636935658	0.21529081943011485	0.1808666692989003	0.196822077438946	0.19452537013847307
Amazon fullfillment People are nice and relaxed even though they are in a work environment. At Amazon they make you feel like you're not at work and they try to make it as fun as possible throughout the whole shift. They give away to employees many prizes especially during peak and throughout the regular work year. The prizes include items like a 55-60" smart TV, Xbox one, PS4, Laptops, NFL tickets, Amazon gift cards and many other gift cards up to 100$, Amazon Echo, and many more. The only shift type at Amazon unfortunately is a 10 hour shift. However, it's only 4 days of work and 3 days off so it makes it worth it. Warehouse does get pretty warm inside.	0.20883889241980047	0.20893159813301845	0.1637180667056412	0.22946539577686112	0.1890460469646789

Avoid Google Cloud Field Sales - Google name, good perks and benefits, good base salary, nice offices - You will not make your number unless you are personally connected with management and are given top accounts. The nepotism is the worst I have ever seen in my career. Certain managers are just openly favoring their friends. - Sales operations is not a mature operation. The CRM data is totally incorrect, payouts for deals often go to the wrong rep... literally a 50-50 shot that you will get paid on what you sold. Trying to get contract changes approved is a nightmare. Facts - - 10% of outside field reps on an individual number made their number last year. Many were not even close. - In my region there were two reps out of 20 over quota. Those two reps, of course, were handed accounts that would have been buying from anyone. All about which accounts you are handed. - The uplifts on quota are absurd. 100%, 150% increases over what that territory did last year. Unless you have a huge, new deal... and given the length of the sales cycle it will be a year or two if you are not handed an account, you will not hit quota. If people were shown how many reps missed quota last year and understood their chances of success coming in, they would have a difficult time recruiting people... and this is an opportunity to work at Google.	0.18967195758962704	0.2408539541899997	0.20307313584725367	0.15001799224752088	0.2163829601255987

Is what you make of it. Fantastic food perks and amenities like gym, laundry, etc. I'm pretty sure you could actually *live* on campus (unofficially) pretty comfortably, I know people who have.  Compensation is generous for employees, but be prepared to be given the runaround by your agency if you are are a temp, vendor, or contractor. [Full-timers] Don't believe the hype, who your manager is matters a lot more than the "unicorns and rainbows" corporate culture that gets all the press. Lay the groundwork for transferring if your boss seems to be withholding information from you, or seems to have an agenda. Set well-defined, NON-SUBJECTIVE OKRs or you may get burned at perf.  [Temps/Vendors] For TVCs, just be happy for the free food and the nice resume builder, your vendor manager probably sees you as more of a nuisance than an asset and will give you the runaround when it comes time to review pay or conversion opportunities. Also, FTEs are likely oblivious of your situation if they themselves were not TVCs before getting convert, and just assume you have sick days, access to internal websites, events, etc.	0.16155597216782883	0.20515101554347606	0.20436537247348913	0.24330234969230205	0.18562529012290402

Apple Retail Sucks! Free access to some software and training to keep current with Apple products. Small discounts on the hardware and services (not phones) Apple Retail is completely different than Apple Corporate. The pay rate is low for any technical company.

Work conditions at Apple Retail are hectic and stressful. Employee scheduling is intentionally unreasonable. Employees are treated like spare parts to be plugged in at any time.

Microsoft is doomed. Decent pay and benefits, work/life balance. Lots of seemingly "intelligent people". Playing catch up can be fun. Game Dept. is the best to work at. Shark tank. Contractors and blue-badgers, fighting for the scraps mentality as Microsoft slowly sinks. All the really Talented People already left. Ranking Review's leaves everybody always at each others throats. Looking for ways to degrade you. It's a bad environment for Innovation. The really nice people end up leaving due to the aggressive, competitive nature of the environment. Intellectual bullies. Lots of bureaucracy to deal with. Stratification. Contractors are treated as in the same category as Janitors, for the most part. Windows Team people are the worst to work in. The mentality wreaks of obsolescence and nazi camp work ethic. One of the Indian Program Managers raped a janitor in building #27. ( Windows Group ) Buildings 25, 27, and 28 are toxic, and so are most the people. Windows Group harbors obsolete mentalities that need to be flushed out before they destroy Microsoft from the inside. In building #26 the Automation Group consists mostly of Senior Citizen like people, old, grey-haired, fat, unhealthy, resource hogs, that are on the edge of retirement.

A Good Place to work Google has a very good culture. Management is very open with employees and information flows from top to bottom continuously. Google has a lot of learning opportunities. A lot of authors and researchers come to present their work and give talks to employees. Benefits are good. The main campus is very crowded.

Software Engineer Track Disclaimer: I realize the experience in Microsoft could be very division/team dependent, specifically I'm writing mostly for Azure and Bing.  1) Microsoft still does great tech., whole company emphasize on tech. and engineering first for the most the time (remember what Ballmer used to say at Microsoft conference). So you can end up with a resume doing cutting edge techs., but how much the industry cares about that when you walk out is dependent.  2) Microsoft is a great place to educate junior people, imo better than most of the "on your own" companies. Your career binds to a tech lead as junior people if he's technically strong (what supposed to be for most of time), you can improve a lot on how to do engineering. As a junior after 2-3 years in Microsoft with a right team you can be technically stronger than Google or Facebook made due to reasons above.  3) Company generally be nice for employees, they don't have good benefits like Facebook does but they do have comparable perks not including free food. For example they have legal insurance and ESPP which I found missing in Google or Facebook. Also they have free drink on quality/variance more or less the same about Google. Also I found their legal team (mostly for international employees) much more supportive/professional in general.  4) Some recent move make me think they are about to find some ways. But in general the moving slow pattern I mentioned below may prevent it from making them happen. 1) Microsoft is not a giant leader as it used to be, so be prepared for hardworking and high pressure (I'm talking about workload more than Google or Facebook).  2) Some times you need to deal with senior/intangible person owning some domains that not easy to deal with, and this also brings some politics issue. Mostly you won't find much in newer companies like Facebook (this also due to Facebook's unique culture I can't tell much). But yah you can still find some in other large companies in Google. But in general Microsoft has more of this kind of things.  3) Company has some issues preventing it from making stuffs fast. If you guys notice how Google struggles to move towards Mobile and still not succeed, Microsoft is just worse than this from this perspective.	0.15902464207838815	0.20193661912373218	0.23453895720899784	0.22178295022453828	0.18271683136434363

Great opportunity, but too demanding at times. Having Apple on your resume opens doors in many different fields. Prospective employers are always impressed and if you leave on good terms your manager will most likely give you a great reference! Also, their benefits are hands-down amazing for full and part time employees. Some feel that promotions can be "political," but it all has to do with the dynamic of that specific team. Compensation is still retail level and this job can become extremely demanding. The metrics they strive for can only be accomplished when the Family Room team and the Management team are 100% on the same page and that isn't always the case. In my experience a lot of managers were outside hires and lacked the technical know-how to lead a team of technicians.	0.20580960327694442	0.2211949619962086	0.17155962289714194	0.26516150144332273	0.13627431038638227
Not the best not the worst. Decent customers, work was ok, new things happen a lot. The name looks great on a resume. There really aren’t too many. Lots of social politics and backstabbing. DONT TRUST anyone you work with. They say there is a work life balance but 45 hours is normal on the floor, then another 10-15 at home and then during ‘peak’ 6 or 7 days a week & 80 hours a week is the norm. Right after that the demoted tons of managers and cut part time people’s hours basically as a thank you.

A great job that I like and dislike Apple pays everyone well. Above average retail pay, amazing benefits! Managers will come talk to us, have a conversation and get to know each other, instead of just nothing-to-talk-about-if-it's-not-work-related. Lot of coworkers, amazing products and accessories to play with. Lot of freedom in dresscode, working hours, taking breaks(no micro-managing on lateness). Lot of talented co-workers with all sorts of talent. We work as a team, support each other-coworkers and managers. Managers here are exceptionally respectful, very well trained to lead (some people say apple hire a lot of outside managers, who cares, most important is they are competent leaders). Lot of very interesting customers, get to see a lot of celebrities. Apple as a company actively listens to feedbacks. Constantly provide things that enriches our work environment like food, music, more vending machine, etc. Apple has so many benefits that even me as a part-time can't even count!  Overall Apple changed my life for the better!! Lifted me out of poverty :D Helped me developed better personality traits like learning to setup expectations, developing habit of thinking outside the box,etc. With good pay and a package of benefits, it also comes with a package of stress!!!  Lot of chinese customers who doesn't understand the product, and doesn't speak English, making it hard to communicate. Some customers haven't learned proper manners. Chinese customers will form a circle around chinese employees, waiting to be helped. While cutting out the willingness to be helped by someone else. Chinese employees deal with unusual amount of stress on the sales floor and genius bar.  A lot of co-workers. Very friendly, but very hard to form a deep connection. Because of several different reasons: 1- When you are on the sales floor, so many customers and co-workers, you will probably get distracted 2min within the conversation. 2- Schedule is so flexible that everyone has a different schedule, so you don't go on break with a specific person. 3- We have a break room, with a lot of co-workers taking break. Some goes to lunch, some are eating lunch. Some are on the computer, others are listening to music. Everyone is on a different schedule. If you sit down with someone... the most you can do is probably a 5 min dialogue. Will sure get interrupted by someone/something else-- other people asking questions, going back to work,etc. Before I came to Apple, i used to work in an environment where i can be next to a co-worker for 2-3 hours with a short 2min task to do every 20min or so. That allows us to connect with each other deeply and really get to know each other's lives. At apple, you probably just dive into some superficial stuff like how are you? Where are you from? Do you go to school? and... I heard that guy has a lot of Apple stocks. Heard of instead of personally listening. And after a year of working here, I don't know half the coworkers. So many of us, so many transfers, so many new hires. Can't really connect unless you take coworkers phone number, and hang out outside of work.  Another stress.. in the middle of a transaction with a customer, you may get interrupted by another customer, co-worker, or a manager assigning you another customer. You really have to step up your refusal skills to survive on sales floor or genius bar.	0.13112691829673456	0.18863815108768306	0.2063148904469879	0.22187741658588653	0.2520426235827079

Frustrating place to work Set schedule. Possibility to work overtime when it is offered. Given time off (even though it is only unpaid time off.) Too much favoritism in the facility based off who is well known by management. No pay raise for any of the employees. As an Ambassador I am given more responsibility to be in charge of inbound or have more work done, but no raise is given. Many of the individuals employed at the facility put forth no effort in their work. Pallets are constantly falling over and needing to be fixed.

don't drink the kool aid. the pay is nice in the beginning, while they actually honor it before they start deciding not to count hours that you work. it's an uncomfortable cult-like vibe. fake smiles and brainwashing material everywhere from the second you step into the warehouse until you get to your work space. it is also a microcosmic modern version of george orwell's 1984. There's always someone watching your every single move. Have to go to the bathroom in the middle of your shift? Go ahead! but now we're going to dock you an hour or pay for 'time-of-task." At times it's as though they're straight up thought police.

Thoughts after 15 years Peers are great. Benefits are good, but not as good as they used to be. The technology being created is still fun, and exciting, but the processes are continually being reinvented. Management is hit-or-miss. Some managers are invested in helping their directs succeed & grow, but more and more, you're left to manage your own career. Content publishing is a dying breed. Editors have gone the way of the dinosaurs, and more and more writing is being shifted to vendors, with writers being reallocated to "content analysts."	0.1560959157073655	0.18181659475817513	0.28311514123394715	0.21562849494324057	0.16334385335727172

Management wasn't great and neither was the pay for the job. If you are one that wants to work a bunch of hours, you will be pleased to work about as much as you want especially in peak season. For me I was one of the first ones hired on at a new location. After months of working I put in for a transfer from third to first shift. That request was rejected stating time at job, Now realize I got the job on first day of hiring. This new location hadn't opened just yet as it was still a bit over a month away. Once opened I was the second group brought in after the first two weeks opened. After the required time had past to request a transfer to a new shift I did so and it was declined for not enough time. I then proceeded to ask around and find those that came in after me and see who was transferring to a new shift and to my surprise I find a lot. I brought this to management who sent me to upper management and still declined my request. It's suppose to go with who's been there the longest to which I was over the many.  Besides this, the pay was crap for the job. I've heard they've since upped the pay, but I suppose they had to as the turnover is ridiculously high. They are nonstop hiring. I wouldn't recommend personally unless you are really hard up for a job. It's just not worth dealing with crap management and not a great pay base.	0.21911051034673323	0.200245151638721	0.24944888870243487	0.21992524531364838	0.11127020399846252

Great engineering challenges, but often slow reaction times, and inconsistantly competent partner teams Compensation is excellent and fairly transparent. Work-Life balance can vary depending on how efficient you are at your work, and of course your manager and team. There are certainly periods of intensely busy schedules. There are some extremely intelligent and technical folks here, and it's really great to be able to learn from them. I think most folks have seen the XKCD comic comparing corporate culture across different companies - it's very true with Microsoft. Folks are very possessive about their Org's ownership of stuff, and can get in the way of work.

Overall, a pretty good place. Some really great people are here! Worked here for a few years. From what I heard, things seem to be pretty team-dependent. I ended up really loving my team, however. And, I always had awesome, awesome, awesome managers that I truly love. I never had to deal with politics here (although, again, team dependent). Benefits were pretty good, and I was able to balance work/life pretty well. I was a little unsatisfied with the work. I didn't really feel challenged. Additionally - and I realize this is quite petty - but hearing about the free and delicious food and on-site perks at Google didn't help. There is quite a lack of frivolous perks that you have at other tech companies. On a more serious note, the company culture doesn't seem very collaborative. I didn't really feel like i was part of anything big ever, or part of a bigger team than my own.	0.20433452983553166	0.22806490992558395	0.21696811635762073	0.21879360539001344	0.13183883849125025

In transformation Working with some of the smartest people around and in cool projects, world-class perks, stellar financial performance and growth, numerous career opportunities inside. It's a different company now: its size now clearly charges a price in terms of bureaucracy, laggardness and politics.

Good experience Apple is a good company because it treats its employees well and provides excellent pay. The culture is also a good thing because the technology industry is on the rise.

Great for stability. Bad if you have ambitions. - Great, great perks. They really make you feel taken care of as an employee and as a person. - Great pride when you realize how the company is changing the world in a positive way and you are part of it. - Really nice people with not many big egos. - Little career progression. The company likes to think they are flat but in reality they have deep hierarchical leves (There were 10 people between me and the CEO) but there is no clear way to become manager and each manager manages 12 or more people. - Sales is an afterthought completely. The engineers are rightfully the stars but for the sales people the salaries are half what you can earn in other places. - In spite that they say otherwise, pedigree counts a lot. Top salesman globally with no brand name makes half (counting comission, bonuses, stock, etc.) of what another salesman makes as base salary and comes from the "right" (Ivy league, big names on resume) background. - If you are not in the right group your day to day work is boring and mundane. - Low engagement of people with their jobs (in the sales org). That makes for very uninteresting meal chats about ski trips and vegas conventions.	0.20258476583668797	0.22398625582336587	0.14277471029150515	0.24182893513489379	0.1888253329135472
There are a ton of dogs... Biggest and best reason to work for Amazon, there are SO MANY DOGS. Dogs all over the place. The compensation is pretty good, though for us Yellow-badges it's not quite enough to live alone in Seattle on. However, Amazon promotes from WITHIN. Find a starting job to get your feet in the door here and then after about 5-6 months, start looking to move up into the Blue-badge jobs, which are Amazon employees directly. Working for the vendors here is a good way to learn the company and figure out how people work and what teams are good to work for. It can be stressful. You'll meet the people that are overworked, or panicking about deadlines, and it can be really fast-paced. It's a high demand environment, but it's really rewarding if you get put with the right people and you have a good attitude.  The corporate world is really shady. Don't flirt with co-workers you don't already have enough dirt on to make you even if things go sour. Always keep a portfolio of evidence against the people you are not sure about. People can and will sabotage you to get a leg up sometimes, but if you are on the right team that doesn't happen.	0.1798337094253279	0.20339138945991758	0.21538859564414042	0.21876588590697044	0.18262041956364375

This is a particularly good time to be working for Apple Retail Apple has one of the best conceived and articulated customer support standards in the electronics industry. So, assisting customers to fulfill their various needs is generally easy, and does not require the customer to be a computer engineer to comprehend and master. Apple gathers an enormous amount of customer usage data and translates that into constant tweaks to improve its products and offerings for customers. That makes my role of offering customer service particularly easy.   Additionally, Apple has an open hiring policy that allows people of any age, gender, race, sexual orientation to work for them, as long as they can offer excellent customer service. And, Apple offers several directions and lots of opportunity for self-development once a person is onboard. It's retail. Most people will never make an engineer's or corporate salary.	0.18621531145511466	0.23721897742669182	0.18582994895603386	0.22771565300220503	0.1630201091599547

Apple can continue to redefine Retail if ... A dynamic environment that seems to currently be in an experimental state as to its employee and employer relations. If you can express an intelligent argument as to an initiative or benefit you require to make your career with Apple a positive one, the possibility exists. Afflicted with nepotism, there is a perceived sense that some co-workers have reached their positions and compensations due to who they know and not necessarily due to what they know.

Six years at Amazon! Amazon is one of those rare companies where you can work and produce products that everybody uses, knows about and respects. As an individual, you're empowered and encouraged to work backwards from the customer to make the best possible experience for the end customer (which we often are too). I've enjoyed doing this with the Amazon Prime Video group and now with Alexa. I'm currently hiring, if you're interesting in doing cool stuff in Alexa, PM me :) Very hardworking and full on, it's a face paced environment and you have to work hard to carve out the right work / life balance.	0.17745391953659131	0.20069985418747313	0.22577157830428962	0.21587089561318415	0.18020375235846192

Chronic culture, leadership, and strategy problems, and outlook is unclear Despite year over year reductions, benefits are good, particularly for families. They also have a few nice perks, though not as much as Google or Facebook. You can learn a lot here when you are starting out. Hypocrisy, competition, and back-stabbing are ingrained in the culture. If you are a smart straight shooter who focuses on results and has great relationships with co-workers (as the "company values" recommend), that is *not* enough. You must play the political game, particularly if you go into management. If you don't play politics, your best option is to stay out of management and quickly find a politically-savvy manager who appreciates, rewards, and fights for you. If you are lucky enough to find such a manager, you'll be put on the fast track. If not, you may have to watch your career stagnate, falling far behind peers who contribute less than half as much as you do.	0.18552792023502526	0.23634331236431055	0.18998842066625063	0.22687506830845727	0.16126527842595634
A workplace that aligns with my personal values Great personable, consistent and admirable leadership. Majority of the workforce puts effort into aligning than realigning on the mission and the company's core values. All the benefits and convenient services offered on campus help you focus on what you do best. Love the people—some of the smartest, most passionate, and committed—I get to work with. No particular cons, except note that it's a pretty large organization that is ran by countless autonomous teams meaning experiences in each team could be quite different.	0.1994100319879635	0.21009302578553346	0.20905620756149068	0.19756852829280758	0.18387220637220472

Great people I've met some of the nicest and smartest people ever at Google. The community is really amazing. Perks are unbelievable: free food, 401k and donation match, generous vacation schedule. I was able to maintain a very reasonable schedule and maintain a personal life even close to project deadlines. You may feel only a cog in a large machines. Some projects must be done even if nobody really cares. Very limited bottom-up innovation or decisions. There are some amazing projects, really pushing the future, and some less exciting.

Good employer but not necessarily the best for international recruits - Free food - Nice weather - Plenty of on campus amenities like showers, gyms, massages, cafes - Great technical infrastructure and tooling - Great colleagues to work beside - Lots of teams to choose from in Mountain View - Processes to progress in the company are well defined - The salary, once adjusted for Bay Area cost of living and taxes, isn't competitive with similar positions in other locations (such as Google's Seattle office, which has similar compensation but with half rent and no state income tax). - Vacation time is very limited (3 weeks), particularly for people coming from other countries, where 4-5 weeks is usually a legal minimum. If you're moving away from your family, consider how hard it'll be to keep in touch given this limitation. Consider the fact that you're losing 1-2 weeks paid time off when you look at the compensation. - Relocation bonuses are paid after relocation, so you need to be able to pay them upfront prior to relocating.	0.17652557913941327	0.18565658410664643	0.23608115970611906	0.23358851558184818	0.1681481614659731

Incredible for a retail environment. The majority of your coworkers are incredible, inspiring, and fascinating people who you can learn new things from every day. There are also very few things you can't do to make the customer happy because of the immense resources that Apple has, so you feel empowered to make decisions. Very fast-paced and the customers basically never stop. Apple also seems to be relying more and more on using less employees to accomplish more things, which can be exhausting if you allow it to be. It's also very difficult to make a name for yourself since you're surrounded by so much other high quality talent.	0.18104877690918417	0.20476562716328717	0.22366884385656405	0.20666243629059333	0.1838543157803712
Lots done right, lots done very wrong Pretty good training program Opportunities to move up or transfer into Good benefits/discounts SEVERELY understaffed, not just for a couple months but for the ten months I worked in 2014 we were always doing 5x our normal payload due to insufficient staffing. Many co-workers got strain injuries / carpal tunnel from the over-exertion  Our training time, breaks were almost always cancelled and our lunches were constantly asked to be cut in half  Schedules can be very bad since chat is 24 hours a day. Expect to have an overnight graveyard shift and to work all holidays. Overnight shifts are worsened by dealing with primarily international customers whom we can't do too much for due to being in another country unless it's something we can troubleshoot but this is limited.	0.1757954378181142	0.21217442940820114	0.20738375636341294	0.21413986862696965	0.19050650778330205

Microsoft Product advisor review - Great perks, friendly people.  Not a pro, but something to consider for new employees:  - Expect people to want something from you, pretend that you don't, and you should be fine short-term at this job  - For long term, really think about what your niche is, and try to brand yourself to fulfill that niche. - Transparent motives behind what management is saying and what they mean: customer service = need more sales	0.1541033494315441	0.20720547273312157	0.20711820382701462	0.2863476113918641	0.14522536261645566

Brand Specialist Lots of opportunities to learn, move around the company, and shape your role into what you want it to be at one of the most innovative and challenging companies in the world. Straight out of college, what product category you are placed in as a brand specialist is often random. This can greatly shape your learning experiences and growth opportunities. On the whole, I would recommend a role in hardlines instead of softlines if you are looking for skills development.

Operations at Microsoft Fast-paced, exciting place to work, interesting and challenging work, never gets boring, highly educated and skilled colleagues, strong compensation and good benefits. Company is moving in the right direction. Constant layoffs - more than in previous years, lack of clear strategy, unwillingness to commit to investing in automation of manual processes, chasing the next shiny thing rather than sticking to a strategy, used to be a place where you could grow your career now it's a place you are fighting just to hold on to your job.

Learned a lot, developed a lot. Great company to work for a number of years. A few pros: 1-Very professional work force molds you into representing yourself the best way you can in your future career. 2-Fast paced and a lot of challenges, teaches you a lot on the job. 3-Fun teams with casual environment, great relationships and lifelong friendships. 4-Flexible work schedule, no set business hours and face time required as long as deliverables are hit. 5-Compensation and Benefits are second to none (but comes with the extra hours) 1-Work Life Balance is a focus area for the company, but almost impossible to maintain a workweek less than 50-60+ hours, or you will not be regarded as a hard working employee. Nighttime work is the norm. It is about how late can you stay up and still show up at work in the morning. 2-Very tough review system, everyone is smart and start playing games to get ahead of each other. Some people get unfair reviews if they are managing up or spend significant amount of time on office politics 3-Random firedrills are a culture, being planful is almost penalized, as plans do not stick and you end up spending all the time to be proactive and planful and not getting the benefit.	0.1664983866820179	0.2270090870337219	0.2155410113934173	0.2449875663973934	0.1459639484934494

Going downhill The org is flattened, less opportunities, more politics. It used to be MS encouraged both staying in one area and becoming and expert, or going broad and enhancing one's skill set. The second path is now very much discouraged. Great place to work if you want to do one thing for the rest of your life, to the exclusion of all else. Very focused on making small incremental changes to the exclusion of doing anything big, new or cutting edge - very risk adverse. Work environment can be very hostile. It depends on your team. Rare to find a really good group of people who create a positive work environment. A lot of complacency. If you are an outgoing person who is very engaged and has a lot of good ideas, MS is probably not a good fit.	0.19930314214297407	0.19701974687458912	0.22032171324169186	0.22749931603403198	0.15585608170671283

Big tech company Amazon is a fast growing company with its tendrils in numerous areas of commerce and technology. Its great to work on something that has a major global impact. Its a big company that can have some issues with bureaucracy weighing down innovation. There are also pockets of political fiefdom where ambitious individuals will put their own needs ahead of those of the customer.	0.1769008851176394	0.20007437390766777	0.21854451119165838	0.22483808168633682	0.17964214809669768
Easy, but soul sucking They recently increased the pay to $15/hr, which is really the main reason why and I so many others applied. You don't interview at all. Just pass a drug test and background check and you are hired. You are allowed to pick the schedule that works in your favor and the work is crazy easy. The people are all super friendly and helpful as well. I never once felt intimidated or nervous. You also can have any sort of look there, no restrictions on that. I worked in the sortation warehouse where all we did was take the packages off the line and put them in pallets to match their zip codes. Pretty much mastered it on the first day. You feel like cattle being herded to slaughter. They ship you all in at once and you clock in and mindlessly stack boxes for hours with a really sad excuse for a break in between. I honestly only worked one full day before getting another job offer. I am about to send in my resignation right now. You just feel like a drone working in a windowless warehouse all day. It may be easy, but it is very draining. I also feel like I am back in high school with how some of the coworkers act. If you are looking for an easy, okay paying gig then this is for you, but expect to get burned out FAST.	0.1506915970275185	0.13017532700442755	0.18958806053376734	0.2549824451300316	0.274562570304255
Work Hard. Have Fun. Make History. I absolutely love this company.  If you're seeking a fast pace, growing, changing, challenging environment, this place is for you. When they say work hard have fun make history, they mean it. I have had some amazing opportunities with this company. Never have I felt that I "fit in" at a company but I feel that here. I used to hop jobs every two years because I got bored but that's not the case at Amazon. I learn something new everyday, I have the ability to impact a company of this size and to me, that's life changing. I have never been more proud to work for a company.  If you're more driven by compensation and benefits, Amazon has amazing benefits. I feel their compensation is fair in comparison to the rest of the market. This isn't even a "con" but more so of a wish, I wish Amazon branded clothing was easier to come by.	0.19679244415421931	0.2057037941524983	0.19420971158088876	0.21743100772942733	0.1858630423829664

Every group at this company is different There are lots of opportunities to move around and switch roles if you find yourself stuck or don't like what you're working on. Every team has a different culture and different way of doing things. There is no one "Microsoft" way of doing things. The benefits package has changed and the healthcare benefit is a pain now. Now we have to deal with co-pays and lots of confusing bills and paperwork at the doctors office. With the old plan, you just walked in, gave them your card and you were done. Now it's just a pain to deal with plus a lot of out of pocket money if you need surgery or anything expensive.  The whole rating system of forcing 7% of the employees to get the lowest score is ridiculous. If they tried to force kids in public schools to adhere to this where 7% of them would always be failing just because their peers were doing better, this would be unacceptable. The system feels forced and not truly based on performance. Trying to fit to the perfect curve means a lot of people get scores they don't deserve. (On both ends I might add.)  The other thing that bothers me greatly about Microsoft is the low number of female engineers and a very low number of females in leadership positions. It's still very much a "boys club" here.	0.13947086321045907	0.17284153458490137	0.2556118755417911	0.25970322415945696	0.1723725025033916

Great company, great outlook and values Microsoft is extremely creative, forward-thinking, and ambitious. I have heard this wasn't always the case here (10+ years ago), so it is a great time to be here and our CEO and leadership has us pointed in the right direction. The culture is also extremely positive and encourages engagement with the community, work life balance, and the company is doing a lot to strive towards improvement with in gender equity and diversity. The run-in with the occasional "brilliant jerk" - i.e., a fairly intelligent, hard-working, driven manager or engineer who lacks the social awareness and soft-skills to handle his fellow colleagues. Fortunately, executive leadership has said there is no room for this, so most of them are either changing ways and at least becoming less populous.	0.12439464326954534	0.2008903573365573	0.1807530766516513	0.2299179976751179	0.26404392506712815
Not a bad job until you get into Management Levels Simpified warehouse work, benefits day one, good starting pay Management and HR do not coordinate... at all. If you have a good management team, you wont for long because they will leave for other employment due to how the ops managers and upper management run things and treat people. They bring in college grads with no work experiance rather then promoting and listening to their process assistants who are the ones actually making things work. If you are intelligent and can see the flaws in the system, it will drive you crazy and dread going to work.  Breaks start and end on the floor, so 15 minutes is only about 5-7 bc of walking time because you cant have food, drinks or cell phones on the floor. Same with 30 minute lunch....when you are doing 10-12 hour days....it becomes grueling. Especially if on overnights. The company reconizing its workers hard work and giving them a little bit longer to relax would make a big difference. If you treat people like robot slaves, it doesnt inspire them to work hard for you.	0.19570841224838106	0.16906321961202625	0.1713406539371086	0.33115455985575326	0.13273315434673075

Consumer Service Advisor Great Benefits, Nice people. Microsoft retail loads FTE up with bonus opportunities and even occasional MS products. Where some companies fail is Human Resources, Job Resources, and a communication stream to management, Microsoft does not have these problems.  The Service Advisor role is slightly privileged, people will trust your training and expertise, you may even be invited to travel to special events. MS Retail is in it's infancy. Every 2 months you will face a dramatic change to how your job is measured and how a situation is handled. You will probably face high-turnover as many positions are judged harshly by these ever-changing metrics and lack of accountability on the highest of management.  No opportunity to shine or show your skill. Even the most devoted softies will never be given a chance to show how much they care. The daily duties are so hardwired that you will essentially feel like you work as a janitor or grill cook -- while company-wide communications will praise you and send vague encouragement.  The only way to grow is to earn the attention of people above and beyond your direct(store) manager, and get them to encourage your career growth.	0.12494814029629835	0.1572335908004455	0.24786532142170278	0.30798313598635185	0.16196981149520148

Just another warehouse worker. Great medical benefits. Steady work, overtime offered on a regular basis. Career choice program will pay for some additional training / school. Non-discrimination towards gender, race, sexual orientation, accepting of trans-gender persons. Advancement is possible for those who move fast enough, put in the highest effort. Everything has a rate, sometimes it can be very hard to make rate. Fast pace, stressful environment, many positions are physically demanding. Positions are designed so each worker can be replaced easily and quickly. Few holidays, mostly work on those days anyway.

Ownership culture, interesting technology, and a bright future Amazon is an amazing company - I haven't seen anything like it. It's a place where you're encouraged to "Think Big" while still having to focus on the details and deliver results. There are truly incredible people working here, and it's easy to reach across the organization and benefit from their knowledge. This is a company where displays of true ownership are rewarded. If you see a problem or an opportunity, don't wait for someone else to give you permission to look at it - go and see! Sure, you shouldn't go off for two weeks working on something new without telling anyone, but management is open to hearing about ideas about what needs to be done.  The Vancouver office is a "remote" office in that it's a few hours away from the corporate HQ in Seattle, but the culture here is very much Amazonian. The leadership principles are consistent across the company (although occasionally open to interpretation), and as we continue to grow the office feels more and more like a "1st class" Amazon office every day.  Amazon has had a bad reputation about operational load, but I can only speak to my own experience - the load is minimal. It is very rare that someone on my team gets paged because of an issue, and almost always that takes place during business time. Having the team handle operations, instead of sourcing it out to a dedicated support team, instills a strong quality ethic in the team and as a result the software is of much higher quality. Amazon is great place, but it's also a huge and varied place. Your Amazon experience will depend largely on two things - how much of a self-started you are, and what team you're on.  There are a lot of opportunities, but you need to reach out and grab them. Very little will be spoon-fed to you unless you are at the lowest levels, and even then there is an expectation of motivation and initiative (or "bias for action"). Waiting for the action to come to you is not a successful strategy, be it interesting projects, new technologies, promotions, or anything else.  Amazon is relatively decentralized, meaning that it's up to each organization, division, and even manager to run their group the way they want. Sometimes things will be circumstantial - inheriting a legacy system, etc. - but often a manager's or organization's policies will greatly impact how much you like work here. Luckily, people are relatively free to move around within the company, so unhappy teams will bleed developers to teams with better reputations.	0.1373319203405981	0.2715511984851222	0.22762379873017577	0.20682106924473845	0.15667201319936547

The New Microsoft The breadth of products and services, innovation, talent, resources and overall benefits make this a great place to work. The leadership team, company strategy and "learning mindset" culture are well positioned to take Microsoft into the future. The company's focus on empowerment has resulted in thoughtful investments in philanthropic giving which could really move the needle in the communities that stand to benefit. Mobility is tough, its very hierarchical and process heavy. The lack of agility to respond to market opportunities or simply have a business review that isn't weighted down by process can make the company feel like the post office at times. There are fewer job openings than in the past and you must have an advocate/sponsor to progress. Doing good work isn't enough and despite more talk of valuing diversity, women and minorities are often the ones who lack the needed advocacy/sponsor to move up or simply stay in the ranks.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Fast paced, fun, young, exciting. A very fun workplace setting, suitable for young people. Open culture encourages everyone to know exactly what's going on internally. For engineers, you have a wide range of team choices, and you are given the opportunity to learn something completely new. There are a ton of great benefits and you will end up meeting and learning from very intelligent people. Opportunities for growth happen very quickly from what I have seen and people genuinely care about each other. The open environment encourages you to step out of your comfort zone. Work life balance, or lack thereof. This will depend on your team. There are teams that work long hours and weekends just because they love what they do, or they want to meet a deadline, etc. It can be difficult to have work life balance with smaller teams, but it can be easier to control with a larger team. There are a handful of negative people at the company that look down on interns or new hires even though they themselves just started a few months ago. Some people get very sensitive about the products they own, even if they are just internal tools, and are surprisingly very unopened to criticism. In the end, it's about the money. If a product is doing very well, there will be a huge hiring push, which can be overwhelming at times.	0.14576451886080405	0.18509832024925263	0.21811089566232944	0.20328978332222228	0.2477364819053916

After a promotion or two, there isn't much room for growth. People stuck in the same positions for 6+ years easily. Easy to get complacent, but it's customer service so you know how that can be. Retail Corporate under Angela is not great, and the changes they've made are slowly making it worse.	0.19742543681196992	0.16457071463370027	0.2045839864269914	0.23680566803272776	0.19661419409461076

It will make you better than you were before you got there.... Working for Amazon will expose your weaknesses. You can choose to work on them and get better, or you will not keep up, and that will also be exposed. Operations at Amazon is a large-scale experiment in natural selection. If you are just looking for a place to cruise and put in 20 years then retire, save yourself some time and do not apply here. You do not belong. It is a knife fight every day. If you are looking for a place to prove to yourself how good you really are, then bring it. Maybe they will let you in. Just know, there will be new people coming in behind you every three months who have a better resume, who are smarter than you, who have just as much desire to succeed as you do. Be ready to prove yourself over and over and over and over as the leadership above, below, and around you changes. Oh yeah, when your stocks start to vest, if you can make it that long, it's pretty sweet. Did I mention it's a tough place to work. Go ahead and cancel your gym membership. You don't have time.

Competitive environment but not much growth Pretty good benefits. Stayfit benefit was nice where you can get a gym membership, reimbursement plan, or a flat stipend. Healthcare wasnt bad either.  Stable job environment. Retention is fairly high and there are a lot of seasoned coworkers.  Company is stable and many product areas to try.  An obvious one, but the status that comes from working for an iconic company. Not as much room for promotion or growth (at least on the team I was on). People were very competitive, but the vibe was that management expected people to work with both ends of the candle burning as the norm.  While there are many product areas, my impression is that exploring other teams and trying to transfer to another is strongly discouraged. Transfering to a different division is even more of a challenge.  Not much support by management to explore areas of interest in terms of new tools or technologies. This might have been a culture trait of my team.  Lots of redundant menial work that should be automated, but no bandwidth given to work on tools for these. Also a lot of the existing tools were slow or error prone and needed to be improved or redone, but again no bandwidth given for these.  Not great at onboarding new employees in my team (I am not referring to the general NEO done by HR). Lack of training materials and outreach to integrate new FTEs.	0.18922149711354722	0.19233642012773958	0.21212428097026131	0.272285907999689	0.13403189378876282

Your hardwork will get you fired. Do wrong and grow. Customer service. 1. Very good pay structure with very less deductibles. 2. Good transport as compared to other companies. 3. No dress code. 4. Eat and work simultaneously on your desk. 5. Very good work culture with good respect. People are friendly and help you so much in your work. 6. Awesome facility staff. Maintaining clean washrooms with tissue papers which other companies won't even keep tissue papers 7. Good amount of leaves. 8. Swap option for the shift. 1. Zero work life balance. 2. Long term work like 5 years can add to building up serious physical / mental health issues when you are a consistent performer. 3. Managers are given so much work that they can hardly help their team members in growth. 4. As you go up and you cannot avail leaves then they trap you to kick you out. 5. After a year of hardwork, there will be a Post Peak Party and that to just for 4-5 hours. Not even a day to enjoy. Food is of very bad quality. Who experienced this party earlier would like to be at home instead of attending the party. 6. Cheap thinking managers are hired and they implement cost cutting techniques from where they have come from. 7. High level of politics in the promotions. 8. Specialty is the only department which is worst of all the department. 9. Few policies are illogical in your work and screw the metrics and you need to choose the exit door. 10. The more time you spend in the same level, the less percentage salary hikes. 11. The companys' punch line is 'Work hard, have fun, make history. In CS, its only Work hard, Work Hard and Work hard. Other departments like TRMS are so heavenly.

I like it here! +Things move quickly, but you achieve and learn at a really satisfying rate +Work with really bright people - if you're tired of being in the big fish in the small pond, you'll love Amazon because you'll be surrounded by big fish +Invent and Simplify - there's no such thing as "well, that's how we've always done it". If you want to update a process, try something new, scrap something that doesn't work, then you'll have support to do it. +Career development is taken seriously. There's no reason to stagnate. +Emphasis on delivering results. I love that everything I do has an end result, I'm not just spinning my wheels and waiting for some business leader to make a decision on something. Traffic in Seattle is ridiculous and more flexible working arrangements should be offered. I understand that working from home is a privilege, but if your role doesn't require a daily onsite presence then the employee should have enough agency to choose whether they'll need to commute on certain days.	0.1301032871618096	0.16123261367970748	0.23844367547506862	0.22014534940468375	0.25007507427873055

Avoid Finance Roles Moves fast and places bets quickly. Opportunities to work in different groups. Leader in multiple markets. Energetic peers. Outside of finance there are some good opportunities. Employees are not valued at Amazon and there is no emphasis on making it a desirable place to work, with finance at very bottom of corporate totem pole. If in finance you will spend most of your time chasing bad data and fixing manual processes, and and almost no time on analysis or strategy. Finance roles seen as data aggregation roles, not as analysts or business influencers. Poor finance tools, bad data scattered across groups, hard to get access, ad hoc manual processes. Long hours and high stress. Fast growth has led to hiring whoever is available so if you are unemployed you can get a job at Amazon, but be prepared to work in a dysfunctional group with bad managers where employees are seen as consumable resources, not assets. Weak managers, low job satisfaction, high turnover so constantly doing multiple jobs to cover open heads, long unsatisfying hours. Met many in finance in different Amazon businesses and across the board finance jobs had low satisfaction. High levels of frustration and stress - the faster growing the group the greater the stress. Many folks hired in who don't realize what they are getting into as Amazon desperate to hire then alters roles. Outside of finance, also demanding but met various people who liked their work, but not any within finance. Weekly reporting cycle is also a grind that detracts from value add work (in contrast to monthly reporting in most companies). If you are going to work at Amazon, live in Seattle within walking distance as traffic on city streets has become extremely congested. Stock is minimal until after two years. No comp increases after first year of employment. If stock rises, then no additional stock awards for future years. Talk to actual current employees and not just your interview loop.	0.20065668373817666	0.1844198769275672	0.1904634639461905	0.24021721238791946	0.18424276300014625

ERC Specialist First thing is New hire orientation, the learning starts right on Day 1. The overall atmosphere is so encouraging and everyday your work is going to affect someone hence its important to be customer obsessed. The leadership principles are always there to guide you and the management team lets you not to loose focus on prime things. Lastly i would say its a great place to work and a company i am looking forward to work with for considerable amount of time. The overall culture is so gripping that you end spending more time in office. Sometimes the workload is so much that you end losing the work-life balance. but Amazon takes care of compensating you for every extra minute you spend in office. Also if you had a habit of working in non-creative environment, then it would be very difficult to sustain this culture because here the basics are completely different about looking at the things and our work. The traditional way wouldn't work here, and hence be ready for work culture which is changing everyday to meet the demands of our customers.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Senior Human Resources Assistant Pro: The only reason I even took this job was so I can have Amazon on my resume. And the year I spent there worked out. I received so many call backs just because I worked for Amazon ( even though I learned nothing). So would I go through this hell of a low paying job again? I mean it did land my high paying job, but that also is dependent on how you advertise to your next employer how you did so much at amazon otherwise, DO NOT TAKE THE JOB. This is by far the worst job I ever had.  Salary: $25 an hour - a 10k signing bonus that is prorated – if you leave before the end of your year you have to pay it back (aka your stuck after taxes take half of it anyways). 25 stocks given, but that is also divided yearly. End of first year you get one measly stock, end of second year you get 3, end of third year you get 6 etc.  There is no work life balance. You are given any shift they want to give you. You sign a contract stating they can change your shift without notice. I was given the night shift and never changed. Even when a new member after me was hired she was given the morning shift because well everything is political in the warehouse. If you want to move up get “friendly” with your manager. If you ever speak out about the issues in the warehouse or your team, be warned they will put you on a development plan.  The job itself: Although the title says Sr HRA – it is at best a data entry, receptionist job. No where near HR. You are required to copy and paste meeting notes into emails. Make sure people punch in and out. Fix time clocks. You learn nothing. You work on nothing HR related. T is a total disaster in there.	0.34565416654836245	0.1553457231269079	0.11446004199298825	0.16228884648917002	0.22225122184257143

Apple Retail is the best of retail This is generally a great place to work, but keep it in perspective. It's retail, not everyone's dreamland. Working with customer's was entertaining and sometimes challenging. Not to mention being surrounded by Apple nerds, which I consider fun. Retail hours suck, there is no way around that. Also, the quality of management fluctuates significantly which can lead to significant frustration.	0.16023027353246003	0.29047941781658915	0.17582024609237504	0.2623770729094034	0.11109298964917227
Great company, but poor low-level management and hiring process. Great salary and benefits. Wide range of products to work on. Name recognition conveys huge status. Great people and culture. Google has an enormous number of divisions, and I can only speak to the one I ended up in - YMMV. My work area was a warehouse with open ceilings, concrete floors, and metal desks arranged in groups of six people in a workspace. The interview process was generic, so that once you are approved, you go into a pool of candidates from which managers pick new hires. I only had a half-hour phone interview with my future boss before I had to decide whether to take the position. My boss never allowed me to work with anyone on a project to get me up to speed, despite numerous requests for help. He assigned me the task of writing the specs for a major modification which included several groups not in my area - a task I would not expect of anyone with less than two years experience in the division, yet he assigned it to a person with less than four months experience. HR won't let you change groups until you have completed a year in your first position, so no allowance for bad fits is made.	0.18562445640568334	0.24333962352341681	0.21823415820668177	0.23866001537873568	0.11414174648548227

Warehouse Lead/Process Assistant Hourly compensation for leads with generous time off options if balanced correctly. Good entry level leadership experience for people with no educational background. Where to begin. One of amazon's core leadership principles is "hire and develop the best," however, nothing could be further from the truth. Amazon likes to dangle a carrot on a stick over hourly associates with empty promises of growing with in the company. I wont lie, at first I drank the Kool-Aid, but empty promises are nothing more but empty. Amazon will consistently hire fresh out of college managers, who possess no leadership experience to be nothing more but glorified mascots. For every 1 successful external hire there are 10 unsuccessful managers that ruin the already poor experience, which is surprisingly possible. All of the cons to hear on other reviews are TRUE. Work life balance is poor, there is no development, there is no training, associates are nothing more than numbers, operations managers cheat to artificially boost performance (throughput.) And finally when a few internal leads are promoted into leadership the offer is disrespectfully pathetic ($47,500 salary to work 14-16 hours a day up to 6 days a week during peak) which is about 10-20% lower than external hires. They feed you the total compensation Kool-Aid by showing you the 8 shares you receive after 2 years which if they don't work you to the bone first you'll actually manage to vest. Amazon is a JOB not a Career for most entry level associates and managers.The only way to change this is to stop accepting these pathetic offers from a company that netted 177 billion in 2017.	0.1833750739486582	0.1442967633069551	0.10874935507045881	0.282642973741909	0.28093583393201893
Very big company with a strong competitive culture The company has great benefits, many smart colleagues, and a pretty good/work, life balanced. (but I suspect many people process Email at home). Microsoft likes generalist. You will do well if you can jump around from area to area and do anything they ask you to do. It is really difficult to get into a position where you can make a difference. The company values state that they want leaders that solve organization problems, as well as write code or whatever. This is reflected in reviews down to the individual contributor level. You will need to have great communication skills if you want to overcome the inertia of just solving the assigned tasks and have your insights understood and innovate.	0.18997811244694937	0.20552798239301306	0.1872691098675963	0.21676372348876896	0.2004610718036722

Great benefits, fair pay, bad career development The benefits were always amazing at Microsoft. It definitely something to consider when thinking about compensation.

One of the best technology companies on the planet Microsoft remains to be one of the best technology companies on the planet focusing on producing software. Company culture is revolving around people, customer, business, and technology. Priorities may be unbalanced in some teams, but in general they are right. Some platform technologies produced by the company are loosing the world dominance, while still remain very capable. But this reflects on what transferable skills one can gain in the company.	0.19442298862102197	0.2029821424667264	0.20235374277401855	0.20595712042524247	0.19428400571299054

Disorganized, understaffed, politics over products (hardware division) Seattle campus hires amazing, accomplished designers to work on device platform. The hiring process is thorough but appropriate and the talent level is great. "frugality" as a corporate value gets interpreted in ways that are pushing ridiculous. The famous door desks are a good example, they are awful, if you need quiet or privacy to work in forget it, the open space is crowded and offices go only to vps. It's a battle to even get a decent dev/design kit setup. The comp package is totally whack (huge "signon" bonuses that extend over the two years before your stock vests, to make up for way lower base than google, ms, apple. And get taxed way higher). Recruiting process was brutal as they seem to outsource the same job to a thousand substandard contract staff. Great, great designers, but understaffed, encouraged to cut corners with some ridiculous cronyism and incompetence as you go up the food chain. You can see it in the current wave of product releases. The arrogance of longtime amazon staff in some divisions vs new hires is horrible and it's no surprise the median time spent there is 1 year. I quit and was contacted months later as to why and if I would consider coming back.	0.18611865476463232	0.19676496524938597	0.1574052908055127	0.22712367342584586	0.23258741575462322

Started out great but toward the end not so much... Free movies, before the last set of layoffs there was genuine regard for employee satisfaction and feedback was often solicited not only to improve business processes but also to gauge morale. After a while, not so much... Frequent layoffs. Whole departments got laid off at a time. I guess I should have figured how it was going to be when the entire management team save one manager was suddenly gone a few months after I had completed training, which btw was before the 2008 meltdown. The entire QA team was let go a few months later and the entire Tech support team shortly thereafter.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Wonderful, if you know what you're in for. An amazing amount of personal responsibility and flexibility within roles and across teams. If you are interested in something, you can almost bet Amazon is in that business and has a role for you. You will pushed to your limit until you grow or call it quits. Amazon is a big place, so your experience will be very dependent on your particular manager's ability to give you big projects and visibility. Unfortunately, there are more than a few poor people managers. Do the research and define your career path early so that you can parachute if things turn sour.

SDET's perspective Disclaimer: My opinion mostly represents QA/SDET culture at Amazon.  Amazon's names looks great on resume. Amazon is only one of the very few companies that can claim such a high growth rate for over a decade. Senior leadership is among the strongest I've ever seen in any company.  You will be working with great developers, PMs and designers. You will work on outstanding projects that will impact millions of customers and generate millions of dollars in revenue. Amazon has lots of great tools for developers, which you can utilize as an SDET. "Work Hard". Yes, you will be working hard. Nearly every QA team is understaffed and hiring more QA folks. Your QA manager would probably report to Sr Dev manager. Read: your team priorities will be based around developers and their needs rather your own. QA manager does not have much power to change that.  "Have Fun". This part was going down across the company, on average. We used to have basketball, volleyball, broomball and dodgeball tournaments. This has stopped long time ago.  "Make History". This has become harder for an SDET. You probably won't be given time to try out cool things in testing and be sucked into project testing 75% of the time. Most of it would be manual. When asked about challenging opportunities (improve automation tools, write test frameworks, participate in hackathons, etc.) my colleagues and I have received advice from managers like "I understand your desire to grow. Of course, we'll do than when we ... [hire more testers, have more time during Q4 and other excuses]. You can always put your own 'extra' time to work on your ideas."  There are too few company-supported QA tools and frameworks. Each org reinvents the wheel with their own barely working automation, at the best. The only company-wide test framework is being promoted politically.  Summary: I wouldn't recommend Amazon for true SDETs (testers who can and want to code state of the art tools).	0.18831508714896328	0.2129838023910476	0.20817485456478402	0.22774829147711734	0.16277796441808776

HR The culture is fast paced and amazing. We use a term "you own your own career" here which is so true. You can take it as far and as deep as you have the drive for, and truly in whatever your interest field is, the company will support you. I've been here 2 years and this will by my 4th role. I love it! I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur but the opportunities here at Amazon and ability to "own" things will probably keep me here forever! Sometimes we are serious about frugality, which means our benefits are different from other large tech companies.	0.18840892651498195	0.21422747700406472	0.19655191050932658	0.2087104027839748	0.1921012831876519
Sales Solution Professional The executive leadership is phenomenal. They have great vision and a deep understanding of the industry. They promote integrity out of their sales professionals and truly care about providing a great software solution. Awful culture! The legacy Microsoft sales reps seem out of date on technology and prefer the method of stabbing each other in the back in order to advance rather than simply out performing.	0.1824790964016744	0.20753266531541922	0.2209241098471685	0.20733485860361095	0.1817292698321269
Ship Dock Associate Pay is good until you realize you make the same as the lazy idiots you work with. Healthcare from day one is nice. The do provide some vacation and paid time off although you will use it quickly when they schedule mandatory overtime. Direct hire process is fast and easy assuming you can read, pass a background and drug test. However I have met people who I am not sure can read, or speak English and with criminal and drug history, go figure. So many it's hard to list. Since the building is new and just celebrated 1 year (with free cookies) there are essentially no people with experience. The "Leadership" Team is predominately 20 somethings that were hired right out of college and have no distribution, management and for that matter, people experience. Add to that the large amount of ethnicities and cultures here and you have a difficult environment to manage in even for a seasoned veteran which they are not. This is political correctness gone too far and no one addresses the issues. Bathroom cleanliness is terrible (this coming from a man) and general vibe is like a large urban high school with all new teachers. Mandatory overtime has been constant so if you want to make some good money for a low skill job then this might be the place for you but if you have a life outside of Amazon than it will be hard. Physical nature of work (constant standing) is demanding especially on the ship dock which for a long shift can wipe you out and management doesn't seem to care and there response is for you to take your allocated time off.	0.15250728602279562	0.29313841112073974	0.23995472796026263	0.13763205887985946	0.1767675160163424

Overall a great place to work..... Apple's standard of quality throughout the hiring process and training process is second to none. They truly invest in their employees and give great incentives such as discounts, training trips and more. The environment was focussed on giving the customer a 5 star experience and handling them with care from walking through the door to finalizing their purchase. They have great back of house systems in place and a great management rotation. It's easy to get complacent and lost in the huge employee base. Every store can have up to 100 employees. I think that their business model could still use some tweaking in regards to what they offer businesses. I was involved in a few product sales for businesses and the offerings were kind of a joke. They do not have enough sales relationships with universities and schools hence why IBM and Microsoft own much of that market.	0.2214266216888816	0.23828074750534162	0.2090999808862811	0.1845777218918928	0.14661492802760281

Great learning, little development possibilities for senior managers. Great learning, awesome team, pleasant open culture with employees, never a dull moment.

Overall An amazing stint minus the fact that place is become political now & HR almost inconsequential. Technology - it’s a big plus specially in cloud technologies where hybrid solutions are a big draw for all types of customer. Empowerment - Most of the people are empowered & can take decisions - depending on their managers though. Environment - Over last few years the environment has become negative, where most of the employees feel choked but decide to stay quiet. Also it has become largely an internal looking company, where there is less focus on taking quick & right decisions or meeting customers but more focus on conducting 5 reviews in a week.	0.18840892651498195	0.21422747700406472	0.19655191050932658	0.2087104027839748	0.1921012831876519

Methodological innovation at fast pace - Mobility is encouraged, engineers can switch teams at very high frequency (I will not advice that though, as per me engineers should try a team or role for at least six months) - Deliveries and results are appreciated, executors can grow easily and just verbal claimers cannot survive here - Hands-on career tracks are deep, software engineers can grow all the way up to distinguished engineer e.g. James Gosling - Engineers or Managers looking for a limited hour job may not get so. Work is at times demanding though work life balance is encouraged and possible.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375
A non-stimulating in-between job. If you're looking for a job that requires minimal thinking with a salary that will just get you by for a few months, this is the place for you. The pay is decent for a company that will hire just about anyone. The starting rate at my warehouse (Robbinsville, NJ) is $12.75 with a 50 cent raise for working at this specific location and another 50 cents for choosing the night shift. There is some opportunity for overtime pay as well, especially during Amazon's peak season which occurs between Nov-Dec. The benefits are very good. They offer medical, vision, dental, 401k, educational assistance, and 4 shares of stock that must accrue for 2 years before they can be sold. They also offer medical leave and an extensive paid leave for parents expecting childbirth. The only other pro to this company is how they offer time off to their employees, but eventually this system fails for many employees after a few months. When you first become employed you are responsible for managing 3 types of time-off you are allowed to use: Unpaid time off, Paid time off, and Vacation time. While they start you off with an abundance of hours at your disposal, improper use of this time will quickly come back to haunt you if you're not careful. Also, if you go below 0 hours of unpaid time, you will be terminated, no matter what excuse you have for not being at work. Most employees staying at Amazon for more than 3-4 months will find themselves with little to no time left to take off from work if they do not stockpile them. Where do I begin...I'm just gonna start rambling. First off, the hours are awful. 10 hour shifts four days in a row really wear away at your tolerance of warehouse work. At first I didn't think it would be so bad, but the monotony of the job really starts to eat at your happiness. Personally, I live 45 minutes away from the building, so in total I dedicate 13 hours towards Amazon daily when I add commute times (this includes leaving extra early to get food). I manage to get 8 hours of sleep but I only have a few hours to myself every day. It's not fun, you wind up being exhausted and sleep through your extra time. You will not have any free time. It's even worse when they add an extra hour every day and an extra day to your schedule during peak season. With so many people in the building, you're bound to get mixed opinions of them, both good and bad. The overall culture isn't so great since everyone is usually complaining about the job. Management isn't the worst but it could be much better, there are often minor gripes among employees daily. The job itself (as a stower) is the worst aspect of this whole job. You're job is to take items off a cart and stow them into cubby holes...for 10 hours a day. If you have something next to you, try picking it up and placing it somewhere else, then putting it back where you found it. Repeat for 10 hours. On top of that, management will be disappointed if you don't achieve a certain rate per hour and will even take disciplinary action. Eventually I moved up to problem solver, which was a more stimulating position since I used a laptop to fix any issues with the items that must be stowed. While this was a more satisfying job, management ended up screwing most of us out of the position by hiring too many and then picking favorites. I went from problem solving almost every day to getting it once or twice every two weeks, sometimes even less. Additionally, problem solving is a position with a tier 2 salary within most fulfillment centers, but the Robbinsville location only considers it to be tier 1. There are many other issues myself and other employees have with this place, but like I mentioned in the beginning, it's not a bad place if you're looking to go elsewhere within a few months. Otherwise, don't bother, this place barely keeps employees for more than a year.	0.12481043501505347	0.18436757692716466	0.13584358920515072	0.4102296468711842	0.14474875198144704

Most amazing company I have come across - When they say customer centric they mean it. Most companies talk about the customer, but in the end its about how much you can make out of them. Amazon is a business but it believes so much in passing the savings to the customer. Every single senior leader cares deeply about any customer impacting issue. Its inspiring. - The best shine and get rewarded. You perform, you'll get attention, compensation, opportunities, you name it. They reward people who over-achieve. - Little politics. For a company this size, I'm amazed at how much a team environment it is. I would have expected different from a large corporate American company. Its not like that and you actually have to talk to your issues in front of your SVP. - Amazing people. Amazon is doing some ground-breaking stuff so naturally they have a lot of amazing people, but not just technically gifted. At Amazon, the soft skills are just as important as tech. So you get to work with people who you admire and look forward to working with every day. Its a team - Technology. Amazon is leading the way in Cloud-computing and across the rest of the company there are other really cool things happening. They have the scale only a handful of companies do. Its stuff you just don't get to see in other companies - Challenge. I doubt there is a company doing anything like Amazon is doing at the pace and scale they have. Every single day I get challenged. Its pretty amazing to go to a job every day thats not only interesting but helps continually grow you - Lean Organizations. Amazon are hiring a LOT, at the same time it never seems to be enough, so there is a lot of work to do. Its not a 9-5. That said, if you are good it should not be 10 hour days or anything:) - Frugality. While I love Amazon for passing so much savings to the customer, they need to get better at providing some more for their employees. Not talking Google but there is a better middle ground	0.22491423803083044	0.2023875506843801	0.19107876939224944	0.19875278128661622	0.18286666060592371

Needs Major Improvement I've met some great co-workers. AppleCare is a toxic environment to work in. I would not recommend this job. The training is a complete mess, they have you trained into other departments without notice and the training they provide is horrible. And the management team does nothing in regards to training to make it better for employees. The management team does some extremely shady things. Apple isn't like most normal employers who try to develop, coach and help their employees be successful. You literally are just a number. I have had several team members without any notice have been terminated and the few I've kept in contact with have said their was no prior coaching, training, or any warning. Which again also goes back to how shady and horrible the leadership team is including training. I have never worked for an employer where I felt like I didn't grow until working for Apple. Apple does nothing to develop it's employees in AppleCare, you are just phone support. They don't have development plans actively in place for their employees and truly do the bare minimum so they look good for their sketchy upper management. HR is also just as unorganized at Apple. If your needing anything done from HR it will take over a week at times, also they will say nothing but empty promises and don't really ever follow-through on what they say. I can truly say the Leadership and HR and overall AppleCare department as a whole needs a serious overhaul. I have worked several years for multiple Fortune 500 companies and from what I experienced at Apple is not what I would have expected. Also, their tools they give you to work and systems always have issues which make it at times extremely hard to do the job and the management team does nothing to help fix the issues and will sometimes try to pinpoint system issues on the team members so the managers don't get in trouble. And I would consistently ask myself does Apple even understand proper leadership skills? Management would consistently talk back about employees to the employees peers and then act normal to their faces. My manager would literally send me recorded phone calls from my peers and then try to make me trash talk with her how horrible my peers are. Also, multiple people on my team left as well as other teams including me, leaving Apple has been one of the best things I have done especially since they at the end of the day don't care and you are just a number.	0.2297391517450105	0.1418176677313667	0.32749646981264086	0.17398249958796544	0.12696421112301656

I am challenged as a leader in a way that I have never been in past roles and as a result I am growing every day. We are doing big things and big things can be hard.

Not the place it once was. Opportunity to work with some amazing technologies and very smart people. Huge variety of work to choose from across a large organization. Life as a Senior engineer can be great with lots of interesting work and you can focus on engineering not meetings and politics. Lots of chances to interact with customers if you make time for it, even when its not part of your role. Microsoft has huge resources and can afford to invest heavily in research and development for the long term, there are only a few places you can work that are really able to do this. If you want to work on massive software projects that have a huge impact then Microsoft has a lot to offer.  Lots of opportunities to take on new challenges and learn new things provided your manager is supportive and your group is growing. There are some great managers at Microsoft and they make all the difference. Find a good one and work for them, follow them around if need be. Life at Microsoft is far better when someone has your back, especially at review time.  The salary and benefits package are still competitive but not as good as they were a few years back. Campus is being modernized and the working environment is good and getting better. For a large company the day-to-day work is pretty low friction in terms of needless rules, engineers have Admin access to their workstations etc. Big variability in culture and working conditions between groups. Some parts of the company are great places to work run by people who respect their reports and coworkers. Where people are encouraged to work as a team and do their best work. Other groups are perpetual death marches run by self-serving management. It's very hard to see the difference until after being hired. Once hired you are stuck in that position for 12-16 months. This is long enough to get a poor review which will make it harder to move.  Competitive culture encourages individuals to show themselves in the best light, even if it means making co-workers look bad or doing things that are not in the group or company's long term interests. The stack rank culture is engrained in the company, don't expect a different review system run by the same people who ran the old system to change things any time soon.  Decisions are often driven by politics and personalities. At the Principal level politics becomes more important. If you are the sort of person who says what they think, even if it is likely to be unpopular this may be your downfall. Being subsequently shown to be right will not help. The end result can be a a lot of smart people collectively making seemingly dumb decisions and building the wrong things. The Peter principle applies and often the politically savvy get promoted for all the wrong reasons. You come across quite a lot of senior people who are clearly just waiting to vest their next stock grants.  Over resourcing results in large teams and empire building. Often teams will vote to (re)build existing functionality "we built our own DB because (we thought) SQL Server didn't meet our needs". Lack of willingness to use open source and LCA's slow responses also promotes this problem. Sometimes this is due to valid IP taint issues but a lot of the time it's not. Smaller teams can often move faster because they are forced to make smarter decisions by their limited resources.  In general Microsoft has been slow to adopt the latest engineering practices. There are good reasons for this on some of their largest products, like SQL and Windows, but in many other cases it is simply a case of "not invented here" and "we're Microsoft, we're different". The fight to get newer (agile) process and engineering practices adopted on several of my teams was a long and painful one. If you want to work on smaller projects using the latest practices then choose your team carefully.	0.21089607045221026	0.2109896893677274	0.13777564980906687	0.22072914411531758	0.21960944625567777
Specialist It was very exciting at first, and a lot of fun to be part of such a respectable company. As a Sales Specialist, you aren't super driven by managers in regards to metrics, which is good for those who are content with showing up and collecting hourly compensation. Best perk? The employee discounts! You will be a salesman and it's never going to be a slow day. You will bounce between setting up devices, and describing to older folks what an "iPad" is. Every day is the same. And the biggest downside is the pathway from Retail to Corporate...

Great experience Great benefits and great salary. Both my team and my superiors were a pleasure to work with. Google is really leading with new technologies which makes the job incredibly enjoyable. Sometimes I felt like the entire campus was geared towards college students. The bright colors, the "dorm"-like designs.

Worst place I've worked - Above average compensation packages if you negotiate for it - There are some interesting and unique initiatives to get involved with. - Some people are fun & nice to work with. - Political and unethical leadership. There are fifedoms that go unchallenged.  - Poor people management & lack of quality leadership. It is not uncommon for employees with little aptitude or relevant experience to be promoted based on politics. They often make poor managers and contribute to negative employee morale. I've seen wonderful & talented employees ignored in favour of less competent counterparts, due to nonsensical personal politics wielded by snr management. Without exception, they all have walked away & into much better jobs. Amazon find it hard to keep talent, & when they get talent they dont seem to know how to leverage it.  - The Amazon value of "frugality" is in theory a good one, however the way in which it's leveraged within the organisation, leaves many employees feeling used and abused. The constant pinching over basic expenses, door desks, computer equipment etc results in employees feeling demotivated and uninvested in the company.  - Type A micromanagement. Everything from MBA managers telling you how to write an email or telling you how to do the job you've been doing for the last 15 years - a job in they haven't done. There is a pervasive sense from snr management, that they are 'superior beings' and this grates, particularly if you find them to be ineffective. There can be lots of focus on face time & clock watching. I was based in HQ (not in a distribution centre) but it felt like I was working a shift job where I had to punch in & punch out. If I was 15 mins late they would want me to stay 15 mins more at the end of the day.  - Incredibly high employee churn. This is for a multitude of reasons: lack of work life balance, Type A culture of micromanagement, 'frugality' & poor people management in which unethical politics pervades. The company bleeds talent constantly, but there doesn't appear to be an interest in addressing the issue of churn - in my team, snr management stopped telling the team when a coworker had resigned, because to do so would possibly mean having to address the underlying & aforementioned issues of why employees leave.	0.09371243301297187	0.2846452632898323	0.31572867101741703	0.14774482682225287	0.158168805857526

Good but don't buy into the myth You will work some very smart people, nearly all of whom are passionate, driven and focused on the customer. The collaborative team culture is amazing. People here will go out of their way to help each other, even if they don't know each other. "Yes and" rather than "no but" is far more common and there is an infectious positivity everywhere. Clearly some great perks with the food which is amazing in London and San Francisco, pretty good in Dublin and passable in Mountain View. The work-life balance is exceptional and managers will often go out of their way to support you in your personal choices and career aspirations. The separation of Google under Alphabet was necessary from a business point of view and now makes it very clear what the business side of the organisation is and does: it is a huge branding and advertising agency designed to make as much money as possible from it's ecosystem. If you are not happy facilitating this mission statement as your day to day function, then it's best to learn to code and join some of the other areas in the business so you can focus on the user rather than the customer. That being said, money is made with a smile, mostly through looking after the best interests of the customer and there have been some genuine drives to put longer term customer success (for the bigger SMEs and large customers) as a benchmark for success alongside revenue. It feels like there is a trend of weak leadership in many areas of the business. The company is now a bit of a retirement home for ex-Mckinsey consultants, all of whom are exceptional problem solvers, very nice and collaborate well, but are not used to driving implementation or coaching and leading others. Given the global nature of the company, senior managers are often geographically separated from their mid-level reports, which contributes to a lack of strong mentorship and development of individuals. Corporate culture is now firmly entrenched. This is not a cool, funky start-up. Competition is fierce at the higher levels and there is the usual smattering of office politics and promotion hungry execs pushing their teams to meet their targets and protecting their empires. People seem to be hired at a level lower than they would probably occupy in another company and salaries are not that competitive - they will offer you as little as they can get away with so do not be afraid to negotiate - it does work.	0.20616723608180376	0.18948452449415745	0.19569408406843627	0.3048581297904516	0.10379602556515088

Get bumped up to an Ambassador with more responsibilities without increased wages.

Managers want you to be handling emails while you're on calls.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375
Feels like many different companies within one huge company - great opportunity for career development - you will learn so very much - unsavory review process (this is coming from a manager who is familiar with how it's done) - 'red' people tend to excel here (refer to Insights training for the reference) - there's an increase in rudeness that's I'm seeing throughout the company	0.18106309175908333	0.20478181721586522	0.20015806149499385	0.23012817707631783	0.1838688524537398

Finance If you can dream it, share why it adds value to the Company, you can build. It's an amazing place to be part of, literally changing eCommerce daily. It combines the best of a big company and owning your own business into one. Smart people working hard! Opportunities to try different experiences are everywhere. You never feel valued. Burnout, and poor management is prevalent. In an environment where folks are compensated for individual contributions, not building teams or working together, there is little recognition for Managers that care for or develop their teams. Good people are forced out of the Company daily due to the rating requirement to force out 10% of the workforce. The compensation does not reward your contributions. If the stock price goes up on future shares you are owed, you may not get a raise. You can go years without raises, even if you are a top rated employee.	0.2012091661028543	0.10417453415470028	0.24827508189421668	0.24476891243446824	0.20157230541376048

Amazon Sortation Associate The pro's of this job are that you are able to have a flexible schedule. 1.) Shifts can be anywhere from 3 hours to 5 hours. This is an issue for those trying to make a decent amount of money. 2.) Human Resources will send out "Voluntary Time Off" requests to the phone of every employee to save money. This makes it more difficult for employees to work during shifts since they will lose a good portion of the labor force. 3.) Then, there's the Process Assistants constantly checking for every Associates scanning package rate. This is an issue due to the fact that some employees will just grab small packages and create a mess on pallets. Then, it also causes safety hazards since Associates then feel pressured to do more work.	0.2289614605505245	0.1862495155922797	0.19538044633644758	0.22088579309543535	0.168522784425313

Each team in Amazon is different, but I'd say I got a pretty great team! -Amazon reviews the code that is submitted to production, so you have an opportunity to grow as a developer. -My work environment is very conducive to collaboration and constant feedback -I can write code that is handling Amazon.com production traffic within a week or two. I feel like what I'm doing is actually useful. -My team has a very high standard for unit tests and other testing strategies, which in turn help you write better code. -Very flexible work hours. You can come in at 6 and leave at 2 or you can come in at 11 and leave at 7. You can work extra on some days to get an hour or two off on other days. Basically get your work done is the only standard, which makes me a lot more likely to work well. -My team has a large diversity - five nationalities, both genders. -Cereal for our floor is a plus! -Being on call. I'm part of a pretty central service to amazon, so being on call usually means getting paged for a decently high severity problem.	0.1757954378181142	0.21217442940820114	0.20738375636341294	0.21413986862696965	0.19050650778330205

I enjoyed going to work, most days. Lots of political machinations, especially as you move higher on the management chain.

Associate Partner Manager - UK - Ok first job Ok pay, 28k for a first job. Very fun and intelligent colleagues. Opportunity to create meaningful projects. Management is poor. They seem disinterested in people management and would rather do their analysis work. This leads to poor team morale.  The general feeling is that we have been mis sold the job. It was pitched as a broad reaching role, with elements of consulting and analysis. The reality is that it is telephone sales and there are stringent targets that leave little time to do anything else.  The attrition is appalling. I started with around 15 colleagues and there was three left after twelve months. This is consistent with other departments.  The main reason for the attrition is the lack of opportunity to move up in the company. There is one small promotion that is attainable. Once a worker has reached this level the job doesn't change in the slightest. You deal with the same work and the exact same clients. Moreover, they hire externally for managers, who usually have an MBA and consulting experience. When this glass ceiling is hit (usually after about 18 months) there is not much you can do to further your career apart from leave.  There are a few other things that I find personally negative, however these are the most pervasive.	0.18083638610495223	0.2300039852570098	0.20120785700426994	0.25260877712548513	0.13534299450828294

Easy to grow, difficult to stay - Great learning opportunity: Working at Microsoft, you get to work with some very competent people, and you learn a lot. I learned more from being a year at Microsoft than being three years at my previous employer.  - Quickly given responsibility: At Microsoft the number of interesting projects greatly outnumber the number of people working there. This means that new employees are quick to be given responsibility of projects, often pushing them into unfamiliar territory and forcing them to grow.  - Good work/life balance and environment: People working from home is not uncommon at Microsoft, and the work hours are generally very flexible. When working at the office there is a good environment and the employees are well taken care of (free coffee, soda, fruit, etc.) - Bloated processes and time wasting: I would say that, on average, every Microsoft employee probably waste at least one hour a day due to unnecessarily complicated processes or bloated reporting systems.  - Unreasonably difficult career planning: In recent years, the HR department has been trying to put in procedures to limit nepotism in hiring and promotion. They have been unsuccessful, but instead they have made it impossible for graduates, interns and student workers to career plan. Most of my peers in other companies have career plans. I don’t even know if I’m still at Microsoft in three months. I've seen incredibly talented young people leave Microsoft simply due to uncertainty and lack of career planning. They now work for Microsofts competitors..	0.09481010299201156	0.21363882540271886	0.22035260231752013	0.234635249346668	0.23656321994108154

A place to not waste your time My previous job was full of time-serving pot plants, so my bar was pretty low after that, but coming to Amazon felt like a night and day improvement for a number of reasons.  My standard answer when people ask me if I like working at Amazon, my answer is "the idiot ratio is low". You will be working with smart, committed people and spend a much smaller amount of time dealing with idiots than I have experienced in the past. I've now had 3 managers, 2 of which were awesome and 1 whom I think should not be a manager. One good thing about Amazon is that it's pretty easy to switch teams (after you've been in a team for a year). This allowed me to move to a manager and organization that I trusted.  Amazon is very good at focusing on things that matter (hence the title of my post). The leadership principles are used every day and that is really helpful if you're a software developer to prevent people from wasting time on things that are 'cool' but don't have an impact on the real world. Yes, it means you don't get to spend lots of time refactoring code or using the latest fad NoSQL database but it does mean that that you're forced to try and maximize your impact on the customer. In the long run I feel like doing a job where your work feels valued is better than having a perfectly architected codebase. The horror stories are true if you have a manager/org who is a slave driver. Upper management is pretty ruthless in not investing in things that don't have a direct financial impact. Hence, internal tools and development environments can feel very underdone. The oncall/pager duty situation for some teams is out of control and means you can never make any forward progress. These teams are few and far between but from my observations they are the ones with enormous turnover.	0.15339553157842684	0.26691661704275904	0.20090991281101336	0.20378011804235355	0.17499782052544702

My Personal Amazon Prep Life I have worked at Amazon for about 2 years now. You get to meet all kinds of people. There are so many ways to talk to leadership. If you have an idea you can share it. The managers are awesome. You can ask almost anyone for help and rarely will someone tell you no. Managers tend to let you do your job without interfering to much. It can be difficult when you are working hard and see other people slacking and they want to blame management. With the amount of people here it is hard to watch everyone every second.

Amazon Fulfillment Center Associate Hard work and a good work ethic go a long way. The company is structured to allow associates to grow and develop. The business model is sound and allows for a safe, productive atmosphere. Management is quick to help associates develop and grow within the company. The company is stable and provides stock options, retirement, education assistance and all types of insurance. Amazon is a large company with a high turnover rate. Thus, it's difficult to feel "at home" in this ever-changing environment.

Hell & Heaven You are really taken care of as far as benefits and similar area. If you do your hardest, Apple will do everything it can to help you make the most of your life. Their culture has been one if not the best experience I have ever had at any job.  Yes, it is Retail and that is a hard part, but they really work with you and want to make sure you enjoy your time.  I really got to learn a lot and a lot of the skills they develop in you are life changing and applicable in life not just in your job. This is on the Retail side only. It is hard to get promoted once you are in a position in Apple. While management says there isn't any favoritism, there is. You'll often feel like those that suck up to management are the ones that get the promotion.  Schedules are incredibly demanding and hard. You will be required to work many days you'd prefer to be off.

Dull & Meaningless It's splendid for someone looking to coast and get some good compensation while doing so. Good benefits, free drinks, and work-life-balance is too good to be true. If you actually care about building products that make sense and have an impact, then this is not your place. It's the tech-equivalent of a Detroit car manufacturer: slow, boring, silo'ed, and process-oriented. You don't get any end-to-end responsibilities unless you've been there for 20 years and have finally 'served' enough time to make Corporate Vice President. Even then, there's a ton of pointless politics and absolute lack of regard for how simple the offering should be and how to serve the customer. Half the time, nobody knows what the hell is going on in the organization. The company is so big and bloated that there's so much duplicate work going on, and zero ownership given to young, motivated, smart people. You're expected to 'shut up and learn', and don't suggest or question anything until you've been around for as many years as it takes for someone to forget when you joined. Long-story-short: terrible company for someone looking to make difference in the world around them.	0.19930314214297407	0.19701974687458912	0.22032171324169186	0.22749931603403198	0.15585608170671283

Work experience really depends on your team You can approach advanced technology and work with smart people.

I definitely tell anyone who will listen that it's a terrible company to work for and they should seek employment elsewhere It's very strange to see your feelings corroborated in the words of several strangers, but what's been previously documented is exactly my experience during my years at Amazon. The average Amazon employee stays with Amazon for 14 months. 14. Months. I have been with the company for less than 5 years, and have been there longer than nearly 80% of the employees. For a company that prides itself on efficiency, a turnover rate like that seems painfully inefficient—and painful it is if you're the one left while your co-worker exits. The work will definitely fall on you, and if you manage to hold things together, even just barely, you'll see that headcount vanish, and suddenly you're doing the work of two people.  Let's talk about leave of absences and people who quit—never in my professional career have I worked somewhere were so many people either walk out or simply disappear. I've encountered more than one employee who has gone out on a mysterious leave of absence only to never return and severe all social ties with other co workers never to be heard from again. We're talking block on linkedin kind of severing.  I've read the comments some people have posted, and I'd like to set the record straight on a few things. The "pay to quit" program is nothing but a PR hoax. That option is only offered to fulltime warehouse employees, of which there are few. It's well documented that the vast majority of warehouse employees are temp workers. Of the very few people who qualify for the program—it's offered during review season, which is when raises, promotions, and stock grants are given. Anyone with a brain knows that $5,000 to quit your job is a terrible deal. It's mostly intended for the poor performers—a way for Amazon to avoid firing an employee and paying unemployment.  Also—many comments reference that if you don't like your job then just quit. You know what, you're right. You can just quit, and if you're that unhappy with your job I would argue that you should. However, I think the larger point here is that this is all a terrible way to run a successful corporation. Amazon needs its employees just as much as it needs its customers, and the fact it doesn't understand that is what hinders its overall success. Other players in the space offer lots of perks to keep employees happy—decent health insurance (Amazon's is terrible), snacks in the office, discounted gym memberships—Amazon does none of these things. Are employees entitled to it? No, we're not, but when it keeps the company from getting and retaining the best talent—the very talent that is necessary to keep the company going and innovating, then it's probably a good idea to offer a few things. I'm not an organizational psychologist, but I'm confident that there are studies out there that say that happy employees work harder, longer hours, and stick around for more than 14 months. If you're an average person reading this you probably aren't outraged, but if you're an Amazon executive or shareholder you absolutely should be.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that Amazon is evil, but it is certainly a contentious work environment where people will literally step on each other to climb to the next level (Amazon's level structure has also been documented), and are even encouraged to do so. If you want a raise—you better figure out a way to eliminate the job of someone below you. It's not the most sinister and I'm definitely not being abused, but I think that the culture is such that it's very difficult to be successful, and ultimately not worth the rewards. Because of this Amazon will remain a stepping stone for most, not a place to settle into a career.  Oh, and I completely agree that the review process is absolute garbage. If you ever had a bad day and said something to someone that was even slightly snarky it will come up, completely out of context, on your review. I know several people who have had "becomes visibly frustrated at times" called out on their review. I get visibly frustrated when people try to come onto the subway car before letting me out, let alone when I'm at work and multiple people have given me conflicting deadlines on projects. The bottom line is that you should never have an emotion. Ever. Of it will be seen as a weakness. Your manager can complain and gossip to you endlessly about people on your team or on other teams, but never do the same. It will come up on your review that you're a complainer.  The PIP thing is also completely real, and I've known a few people who have gotten one completely out of nowhere. While nothing this terrible has ever happen to me I have seen it happen around me. I have known people who have been screamed at by their managers, cursed at, and even had comments made to them that were blatantly racist. While my personal experience hasn't been completely tragic, I definitely tell anyone who will listen that it's a terrible company to company to work for and they should seek employment elsewhere.	0.1981345576967838	0.15591091394954687	0.11750236770308613	0.3053923272261976	0.22305983342438565

Editorial Manager Amazon overall is a great place to work for! The benefits packages are exceptional. I have worked for several Fortune 500 companies and my health benefits are by far some of the best. I am pleased with the compensation packages and how they have progressed yearly as well. It is a fast paced work environment where creativity and hard work are rewarded, which I deeply appreciate. It is a great place to learn and grow your skills in an environment full of well-qualified leaders. If you get a good team and good manager you will likely love Amazon. But in management you are stretched quite thin, so if you are at the point in your career where you need or expect coaching it will not happen. Amazon is a survival of the fittest type of atmosphere. Each year the bar is raised to weed out the weak. At first this was a challenge I loved. But then as you aspire to move up levels in the company it becomes a barrier, because you can change titles and clearly shoulder more and more responsibility, more and more projects yet they can state the bar for a promotion is out of reach so it becomes discouraging after all your effort. It is an atmosphere of leaders so in order to stand out you take on more projects to get noticed for promotions. Promotions in general are few and hard to come by unnecessarily which discourages you from staying at the company past a certain timeframe. There are many managers that truly have no idea how to manage people. I am truly glad I started my career in other companies that invest more in HR support prior to coming to Amazon as a people manager.	0.205330492795234	0.229539764871528	0.21794384410729276	0.2477186667816165	0.09946723144432881

lack of support, little or no relevant training and badly structured programmes -Free coffee -Fancy offices -off-site visits -work is so convoluted its easy to not do anything The biggest problem with employees of Micfrosoft is that it is filled with people who admire Bill Gates and want their name branded with the company rather than doing something valuable. There is a lot of middle management which blocks people from progressing and the worst thing is the overt competitiveness to step on each other to rise to the next level. There is a lack of opportunities and the skills developed in the business roles you could teach a donkey. It is not real selling.  I would advise those who are ambitious, intelligent and go-getters not to work for this company. For the graduates, there is not any well structured training (they lure you in with a trip to America) and there are consistent brick walls. The culture is strong and they make you believe it is the greatest place ever but it is not. in reality, the company is a shambles and is only successful off the back of the legacy Bill Gates helped to build at the prime of the company.	0.12333523519809733	0.1660935747047592	0.30403569606972886	0.2634976032604317	0.14303789076698284

I enjoyed the job, but could not continue due to being unable to adjust to night shift at the time. If you need a job, seasonal work at Amazon is a viable option. Although people tend to poorly review Amazon, I believe the reason people dislike Amazon is because of the demanding pace and vast amount of walking. Buy some comfortable shoes, eat healthy foods, and drink lots of water, and Amazon is not so hard. I personally enjoy challenging work and breaking a sweat, and Amazon is a great place for those with work ethic. Some of the computer systems seemed aged, the machinery is loud, and the pace is not comfortable. However it is not the nightmare job that those of lesser work ethic claim it is.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743
Worst Management Amazon Business is best in the industry, Great salary and Infrastructure! Poor Management, Disconnect with employees, No trust on employees, Dirty Politics, No platform to show your skills. I must say that some people come with prior experiences and the management should concentrate on right person on right place and not the favouritism, gender based bias is also there in the teams and bribe system is in the blood of some managers which is snatching growth opporties from deserving candidates. If we talk about the core skill, once the candidate gets in the role there is no effort to maintain or improve candidates existing skills. I understand it is important to focus on the assigned role, but this limits the candidate to role assigned withing AMAZON and makes it challenging to switch thier jobs.	0.18452148779438404	0.18755904028028808	0.20685539708238704	0.31287369581634206	0.10819037902659863
At Home Advisor Great Pay! No Commute! Great Benefits And it stops right there! Micromanagement to the point of irritation. Managers who are not knowledgeable. Constant rude customers who swear, demean, and yell at you on almost every call. Dealing with customer who have valid reasons for being upset due to subpar products and software, and having to pretend that the customer is wrong. Shift bids every 2 months which are based on CSATs and other unattainable metrics. Working with contract employees who have had little to no training. Not allowing customers to access their own information due to some false sense of security. I would not recommend this job to anyone who wants to have work-life balance, pride in the company they work for, a support team, or a sense of self-respect at the end of the day. I am in the Pre-management program and cannot wait to change things at Apple for the better.	0.20903991922372445	0.19082054837669146	0.14732407830994898	0.2692969968046709	0.18351845728496416

For Engineers, this place is a joke You're given independence and the ability to do your job how you see fit - some of the time. Most of the time management runs around like a chicken with their collective head cut off and priorities constantly change. - The salaries are competitive, but not particularly high, despite what their so called slide deck proclaims. Keep in mind that your stock purchase and "bonus" is included, so $160k at Google is the same as $210k at Netflix.  - Constant threats of firing, a culture of fear and throwing other employees under the bus to save your own skin. The threats of firing lead to crunch and absurd stress levels.  - Employees aren't as intelligent as other high tech firms, they're hired more for the ability to play corporate politics than technical skill.  - To follow on the above, the average stay here seems to be about a year. Understand that Netflix isn't an engineering company, it's an entertainment company and a fragile streaming infrastructure and clunky front end is built to consume that entertainment. But content is king, not the technology, and it never will be.	0.16150814150808898	0.20542058486368003	0.17319791354945682	0.27532370477824086	0.18454965530053316
Sr. Operations Manager Very good leadership experience. Good pay and the ability/expectation to drive change. Strong culture on providing specific feedback on performance and opportunities to improve. Very long hours and work weeks. It is not unusual (and usually expected) to put in 70 plus hour work weeks even outside of peak. GM/Regional leadership is very spotty. Some very good leaders, but way too many poor leaders who focus on their own success at the expense of their managers. Managers are viewed as expendable and are lured/kept by providing stock shares that vest in the future.	0.09573796450814347	0.24594889776938497	0.22211361018150041	0.24822720063008846	0.18797232691088273

Great to work! But it's a big company with all it's anchors... Very smart people developing awesome, world changing products. Great benefits, more or less competitive compensation. Lots of opportunities (minus the cons). In general, most are supporting of doing social good (e.g. taking time to pursue philanthropy). You can be yourself. BIG company, bureaucratic culture.

Don't get comfortable High pay, freedom and responsibility. Everything else. If you want to work 90 hours a week, have no family life, and still get fired after nothing but glowing reviews, then this place is for you! In my case, I gave direct, actionable feedback about a colleague, and that led to my dismissal. The culture deck says feedback is never used to retaliate - but that's not true at all. So fair warning - if you give someone honest feedback about how to improve in their position, be prepared for that to bite you later on. Politics is real here - people are retained or promoted based on who they know, and people are so routinely fired here, regardless of their performance, that everyone is numb to it. Glad to see my time here coming to an end. If you like playing dirty politics at work, then you've found a good place.

Milk you for everything you're worth Overtime hours were a plus which would make the paychecks worth it. 10 hour work days so you do get 3 days off, but that is only when it is not busy. During the winter, it gets increased to 11 hour work days. The pay, with overtime included, was the only thing worth it about that place. Everything! Management sucks the life right out of people and use their efforts to make themselves, and their bonuses, look good. The rate is manageable to hit but don't think about stopping for a minute or they are all over you. Ironic because if you go above and beyond, no one seems to notice at all. Any chance to write you up they will and make sure not to go to the bathroom during the shift since that's an instant write up. VERY strict on breaks (standing back in your station 100% ready to go) or you guessed it: WRITE UP! No second guessing about firing people, which is why the turn over rate is through the roof! But that is what they rely on. Management is quite happy to discard someone as soon as their hourly rate is not what they want, although if you do a good job, they will pull you from one area to do another and another and another. So do not work harder than the bare minimum because you will never get recognized for it or see any sort of promotion. Wouldn't use this job as anything more than a temp. stepping stone to something else.	0.2157590825748193	0.18638404318738078	0.2714507432052434	0.18007423206049566	0.14633189897206075
A challenging place but also a good place to learn There are a lot of great things about working at Amazon as a recruiter. It's the fastest-growing large company in the world, so it has a lot of resources and a lot of challenges that will help you improve as a recruiter. Most of the people you work with, especially the teams you support, are extremely smart and fun people. Amazon is a well-known and a (mostly) sought-after employer. You help build teams that build products that impact tens or hundreds of millions of people and often make the news. They are slowly but steadily improving the benefits to their employees - more supportive parental leave policies, more liberal internal transfer policies, better offices/buildings. They also generally pay well against the overall market. They are a challenging place to recruiter as well, while that can be less than fun at times, it means you will become a better recruiter quickly. I'm pretty confident that someone who can successfully work at Amazon for a year or two can go on to be successful at pretty much any other company. They also have nice little perks like fishbowls (talks or performances by popular speakers or up-and-coming bands) and the holiday/summer party were fun. Like I mention above, Amazon is a challenging place to work in recruiting. They have grown insanely fast over the last five years, so they have tapped the US and Canadian markets pretty hard already. Finding new engineering talent who seem qualified and haven't interviewed in the past is very difficult. They have unrealistic expectations on their recruiters that add unnecessary.  Everyone who works there is very serious about their job and has strong opinions. Most are good at listening to other people and making decisions based on data, but you need to be able to take critique and work with other people. People will push back on your ideas.  While Amazon is pretty competitive in the area of compensation/perks, I don't feel it is very competitive for it's level of company. By that, I mean if you compare them to the overall tech market, they are very competitive. However, the people who are considering Amazon are typically also looking at places like Facebook, Google, and Uber. The compensation/perks at those places are a definite step up from what Amazon offers, so even if you enjoy working at Amazon, it makes it difficult to stay there when you hear you can get a significant raise, work on equally awesome projects, and get all your meals free at a competitor.	0.17511292189225006	0.22236623802220717	0.22151466780970588	0.2442203920858905	0.13678578018994653

Great place to work great people (when you are on a good team), flexible work schedule, challenging work, new things happening all the time, you won't be bored since there is so much to do Not like other tech companies that pay for everything. You won't get free lunch here :). Not as many perks as other places. Seattle is expensive. Sometimes workload is huge.

People don't waste their time on process here. (From the point of view of a new engineer.) The culture is motivational. You have a lot of freedoms that come with being your own boss but none of the crap that comes with it. Your manager gets that crap out of the way for you. People genuinely try to do the right thing and make connecting with friends, family, and your interests a better experience. You get to play the explorer. We solve problems that haven't been solved before. Hackathons are a thing. And they're cool. Free food is pretty cool. Haven't encountered any. I haven't been here long, though. I will probably have something useful to put here next year.	0.16909037044305736	0.160512084162818	0.2214662398136918	0.2546491094516777	0.19428219612875522
So far so Awesome First let me give you the bad. There is alot of miscommunication when it comes to the hiring process. I was lost in the system, wrong title, wrong pay, wrong mananger. They do everything that can to get this fixed ASAP. Just make sure and follow up and save all communications to refer back to. Now the good. Amazon makes you feel like a human and the welcome seems very genuine. The training in Leadership not only helps you on the job, but also in life. If you go with a negative attitude, you will leave with one so my advice is to go expecting great things from Amazon. You get what you are out of life. Amazon gives you the best perks for it so take the time to get to know your job, learn, learn, learn, and move up in the company. You will quickly see a Tier 1 Associate move to a Tier 3 in a matter of weeks or months. It's truly up to you. Safety is the number 1 priority along with the customer and the associates are a team no matter what your pay grade is. No one looks down on you and I love that. If they do, it doesn't show. So apply and take your life to the next level. Miscommunication at the initial hiring stage.	0.06699207206625885	0.3349603603312941	0.18985032437151797	0.23589705059421273	0.1723001926367164
Excellent learning oppurtunity Whatever people say about Microsoft - is so not true. its a great company, a great place to work. The people are smart, dedicated and very professional. Microsoft follows the rules, focuses on customer, and has a perfectionist attitude in everything they do. If you're only looking for enjoyment - dont join. If you're looking for a great place to work, learn, collaborate, re-invent, promote and earn - definitely give it a shot. Workload can be very unpredictable You have to sell yourself to management to be given a good rating at the end of the year.

Changing the world one app at a time. Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people, literally. It's a lot of pressure to get things right and drives one to do the best work of their lives. 2+ years later I'm still blown away by the talent and creativity of people I work with. It's a lot of work, teams are usually strapped for resources and under pressure to deliver on strict timelines leading to high stress and long hours at certain times during the year.	0.1316545382668607	0.23352529982237186	0.2187025872922103	0.20911189861134533	0.2070056760072119

Feels like joining an elite squad of super engineers Facebook hires comparable to the best talent I've worked with in the industry, with regards to smarts -- but also with at least a modicum of social skills :)  Enormous opportunity to influence business direction, chase after your own ideas, and really stretch yourself to your fullest potential.  Almost everything that should be provided is, without lengthy approval processes, unparalleled trust in employees at all levels (you don't need to be a bigwig to get perks).  Employees are empowered to build anything, any app, service, feature. If you are a big fan of autonomy and self-driven growth, Facebook is the place to go.  Managers don't bark orders or give commands, but spend the vast majority of their time as a support role, and encouraging leadership between engineers. Can be intimidating at times, and coworkers definitely work a lot. Perhaps similarly to startups where everyone is motivated. You have to set your own work-life balance, but flexibility exists to allow you to do so (you never feel intimidated to have to work long hours, it's more of a self-motivation question).	0.14588215191977796	0.21542595928509042	0.24233729034042434	0.23171015722693244	0.16464444122777494
Awesome Company, Great Job Compensation is tied to the company stock, which brings a huge windfall when the stock is doing well (which it has been forever). Great management with clear vision, compassion, and focus. Many areas are run like startups, with very high levels of empowerment. Can be long on red tape and complex processes for certain things.

Competitive salary and benefits, potential to work on important products and projects with smart & hardworking people, flexible work/life balance, CEO and executive leadership team seem committed to overcoming the sins of the past.

A Dying Company There isn't a lot. The overall package is perhaps a little over market. The health insurance used to be excellent, but has since been abandoned. This company has failed in almost every way it could. With its stack ranking system it aggressively pitted its own people against each other and wholly sacrificed any software company's most critical asset - cooperation. Amazingly, in their greed to squeeze out more productivity, senior management failed to predict that this would happen. This is supposedly a company of exceptionally bright people, and yet management could not predict something as obvious as that? Along with cooperation, they lost morale, enthusiasm, innovation and team spirit. Working for Microsoft is like being in the Mafia, where every team and every individual is looking to take each other out. This is a verbatim quote from my former manager: "When you talk to someone from {Team X}, smile, but hold a knife behind your back". Those two teams, which needed to work closely together to achieve any modicum of success, were locked in an epic WAR which was dysfunctional, ultimately laughable, and most of all *typical* at Microsoft. Neither side shared an ounce of information about their system, critically needed for the other side to integrate their software into, and the result was an execution failure as absolute as the disregard for the final product that each contributor shared. Like a Big Brother-style reality TV series, Microsoft brings out the worst in people, and not surprisingly, in the software they need to produce as a team. Also, do not think that you will be able to innovate at Microsoft. They talk (read: lie) a big game about innovation, but the fate of new ideas is that they take a long (several years), winding and highly political campaign path and ultimately always end in the trash bin. Unless, of course, Google releases the same idea in the meantime, then there might be a chance. Why? Because Microsoft does not innovate. It never has. Its MO is "embrace and extend". Wait for others to invent, copy the successful inventions with more resources, and try to steal those inventions away from others. The other great failure of this company was not to recognize that that model could only have success in the slow-moving 20th century. I remember being brought into an all-hands meeting where it was explained to us that we need not worry about Google's acquisition of YouTube. Now that we've seen its success, we were told that Microsoft was going to come into the market second and trounce the competition, as it always does, with its new product "MSN Soapbox". Yea, OK. Has anyone ever heard of that? If you work at Microsoft, you will be told that they want you to innovate, but it is literally only an internal propaganda campaign. Lying to the troops ultimately does not inspire them.	0.18844347470367356	0.14928638905096217	0.26585247365239856	0.2632350531189291	0.1331826094740367

Ability to give and receive feedback and it's a part of the culture. You are always expected to perform highly, they create that environment of uneasiness. You can't be human and have bad days or go through personal issues that sometimes affect you, you know, the ones that happen in real life. You literally eat and breathe Netflix. Work life balance is based on your team culture and your boss. At the end of the day what your boss says, goes. HR doesn't do a great job at managing team energy.

You can't just rely on your lead. Best is to keep in loop everyone about your work and do have written record like email what you talk or discuss with your lead.  - Once you get bad review, there is not much you can do as you are threatened to leave the company instead of actually justifying. And, then you can't even apply in other teams in Microsoft if your rating is bad.  - Poor management because of which ICs have low motivation & energy  - People are more eager to get good review and that too not by really working but rather use their links	0.2579110152003277	0.13353149054912178	0.2076056680343648	0.07730770505475475	0.3236441211614309

fullfillment associate Amazon us a great place to work and begin a wonderful career. They truly respect and greatly value their employees. It is challenging yet rewarding. Well the breaks don't seem like breaks, it feels like rushing to break just to sit down for maybe 5 minutes then rush back from break and for lunch you better know how to swalliw your food whole or chew extremely fast cause you might get 15 minutes to eat by the time you walk to the nreak room and heat up your food. Going to break and lunch is a lot more like running a 100 yard dash than actually taking a break.	0.1699726406539998	0.16134959507477636	0.2174040502104305	0.25597780323195357	0.19529591082883982

Changed a lot over the years Great benefits, good discounts, pay is better than other "retail" jobs The job can be grueling. Career opportunities are held as carrots in front of aspiring employees to try and keep them engaged with little to no actual advancement potential.  No "upward movement" possibilities from retail to corporate regardless of experience, all movement is lateral.  The quickest way to get an actual promotion is to leave, get the experience elsewhere and then come back.  Promotions that do come are often based on personal relationships with leadership as opposed to quality of work.

A Lifetime of Operations at a Tech Company The roles have been challenging, dynamic, interesting, ambiguous and evolving. The people that I've gotten to work with are great (for the most part)--smart, driven, effective--they're what has kept me around for so long. Bias towards the new, shiny, sexy projects often leaves Operations teams and other cost centers at a loss for resources and support. The basic conflict of interest between Ads Sales and Ads Quality/anti-fraud teams is a constant source of frustration.	0.18720726747331853	0.18729037068771318	0.21752809583024504	0.2385096922944131	0.1694645737143102

Best world class company to work-in, but you should be L4 or above to enjoy the full benefits!!! Overall its a best company for the environment , work culture and flat hierarchy. Personally one should be lucky to have a manager who is 100% following the Amazon's policy, and you are screwed if the Manager bends the rule as he/she wish (Though, this happens with most of the Organizations in INDIA even though they are world-class, blame is on the people not the Company) same applies for AMAZON. -Amazon is a serious bar raising company with total freedom to the employees the benchmarks are raised more frequently which is definitely challenging to many, thus employees eventually loose work-life balance. -Internal Transfer is high hanging fruit most manager doesn't encourage or support such movements as they might suffer within the team to get a new replacement resource	0.19442298862102197	0.2029821424667264	0.20235374277401855	0.20595712042524247	0.19428400571299054
a good company, but..... this is a good company to work for with a benefit package second to none. the atmosphere is a great environment for growth and expansion. The ladder for success alone is a incentive to rise above the ranks and take bigger and greater responsibilities and eventually take the mantle of area manager or GM. The benefits are the second reason to work for Amazon with full medical, dental and optical offered. a 401k plan and a retired plan to boot. They also hand out stock options to every employee. For all fantastic goodies Amazon offers it does have its drawbacks. this is a young persons job, anyone over the age of 35 with any type of medical problems or conditions need not apply because to use the job can be and generally is medically speaking hard on the body. if you get hurt on the job the workman's comp team has to review and decide rather to pay you or not. They say there's fun times at work but don't get it twisted the work is nothing short of slave labor. Is it a good company to work for? Yes and no....Yes if your young and in good health and No if your older and suffer from old injuries or surgeries. The amount of walking, standing, crouching, lifting( the weight is suppose to be less then and up to 30lbs but in reality its around 30 to 50lbs and the bulk of the weight is in books) and twisting can and generally does break down the body and the push to go faster will break you down you mentally and physically. Is it a good company to work for: Yes, young people sign up and older people stay home.	0.18368596968759185	0.1688224049755959	0.24861897368035618	0.23050837223616363	0.16836427942029253

Good as a stepping stone Good staff benefits, stable work environment,lots of training provided, quarterly company events. Beautiful from outside, but only insider knows the pain.  Company model & procedures are too well organized, what you can learn other than your own responsibilities are limited, also you will have restricted freedom to work efficiently. Creative ideas always took decade to be finalized.  Top management are likely to promote sweet talker not the best performer, they intend to cover their eyes by doing nothing but put lots of pressure on existing employees without clear development plan and career progression. For example, most of the representatives stay in the same level/ role for more than five years. One more thing that I don't like about Apple is office politics.	0.13318963888955163	0.2815480977637469	0.12288329778500293	0.27026888670242755	0.192110078859271

Good benefits, friendly coworkers, nice paycheck, feels good to have 3 consecutive days off, you are given plenty of time to use, and they do have activities for associates during the summer, and holidays. I can't stand the fact that it's no work-life balance. The 10 hour schedules suck, I'd rather work 8 hours shifts 5 days a week.

Good if you are a real fan, not for you otherwise. The company really cares about its employees, great benefits, perks and great campus, work-life balance is really good too. You get to work in the products millions use, and if you love MS technologies... well, you are using/creating them. If not a real fan of Microsoft technologies, consider yourself tied up, you won't work on anything else other than MS specific technologies/environments. Makes sense from the "protect your own brand" point of view, but I found it really annoying to be closed to great technologies you have access in all the other companies (let's say, to use Ruby/Python for a side team stats project, you will probably be looked at like a weird being). That for sure makes you fall behind other engineers in the market, limiting your scope of development.  The so known calibration at the yearly performance review creates a working environment of "I won't help you because I don't want you to be above me", and I really felt that, I was even criticized for helping other teams in my organization because I should had give total priority on my team (it's not that I was not doing anything for my team, but I was the one that could help the other teams and that also benefited us).	0.18273588762796694	0.20782471283578177	0.1968395449780354	0.21918601089133083	0.19341384366688494

KELLY SERVICES APAC DPT There is nothing good about Kelly services at all working under Kelly services, horrible management, lack of training, when ILOG is not working Kelly do not pay employees, horrible and unprofessional team leads. I blame apple for allow Kelly services to have employees slaving all day and make pocket change when apple would hired candidates directly pay them more money and give them full benefit for the same exact position . it is very sadden that apple president can live with himself knowing he have folks working under staffing agency and get treated horribly . Apple should end the contracts with the staffing agencies immediately , although I'm still a customer I do not love apple products anymore, because I am the same customer/employee who treated like trash by apple's business partner. Why allowing people to do the same exact job for less money no benefits and rather spend thousands of dollars paying the staffing agencies?	0.21801627457026918	0.22160521093049623	0.24440428909238565	0.20632106955789667	0.10965315584895215

MODERN SLAVERY None, seriously. I cant think of any Poor pay for all the work and commitment you put in. They are always watching you, timing you on everything you do. Even if your doing your best they never motivate you or tell you positive things. They only tell you what ur doing wrong. 3 consecutive hour working and then a 15 min break (i had to walk around 8 min to get to the nearest bathroom so i was always late to my station, without having the time to eat something) so that resulted in me passing out after an hour for extreme pressure and very tiring. I was only there for 2 days...After that i decided to just quit. PLEASE DONT WORK HERE. Im traumatized, tired, stressed... this full time thing is not Normal. 11 hours almost an entire day and just for 130 dollars a day is a JOKE.!!!!!

Seasonal Warehouse Associate - Moreno Valley Very informal place to work. If you are there long enough, they offer tuition assistance to learn a career. First, they weren't truthful about the pay. We were told at orientation that you would be paid an extra 50 cents an hour if you took a night shift, and an extra 50 an hour if you worked a weekend shift. This is not true. When you ask a supervisor/manager/HR about it, they have no idea what you are talking about. next, It's a boring job. The place is extremely disorganized, but the employees are micro-managed to death. It's a huge (1 million sq. ft.), 3 floor, facility and the only set of restrooms are on the bottom floor. So depending on where you are working that day, sometimes you can't get to the restrooms before you have to turn around and start walking back to avoid being late back from break. If you catch yourself making a mistake, there is no way to correct it. You just have to let it go through and realize you might be written up/fired for it. This is especially bad, because there is no learning curve for the job, and new employees are held to higher accuracy quotas than permanent employees. Permanent employees have to work faster though, which leads to the problem of you trying to stock shelves where someone has dumped a cart full of random objects, packed them in with their foot, then scanned them and run off Obviously, it's hot and dusty (it's a warehouse).	0.1764500341414924	0.15242681972583133	0.15448014671264362	0.29856781689332784	0.21807518252670477

It's a job Well-known perks like free food, busses, new computers, etc. However, there are also better pros: - Google constantly tries to improve employees' skills, technical and otherwise. Of course, this is done entirely for the benefit of the company, but it is also useful for employees to build their resumes. - Internal tools and processes make it easy to get a lot of work done, and feel productive. - In some ways, the organization isn't hierarchal in the sense that you can ping/email almost anyone related to your work and engage in useful conversation, without feeling like a lesser employee. - Good weather in Mountain View, CA. - Google systematically undervalues new employees' contributions. - Promotion process skewed toward people that have been at the company the longest, rather than the highest performers. - Many coworkers are too egotistical.	0.1804414781526276	0.20407877407935734	0.19947089232507462	0.23277124914421882	0.1832376062987215

Faceless cogs in a relentless machine - Working at Amazon is a great opportunity to work with the industry leader in several areas, and get an inside view into how things are done at that kind of scale. - Lots of very smart people work here, and if you play your cards right it's an excellent opportunity to develop your skills. The culture at Amazon is abhorrent. Everything is in service of the bottom line. "Frugality" is literally one of the core tenants of the company, and it's used to justify everything, from the fact that you have to provide a doctor's note to get an ergonomic desk, to the fact that the benefits and holidays are extremely weak. The latest fiasco is that Amazon is actually violating OSHA requirements for the number of available bathrooms because our office space is so insanely overpopulated. All inquiries into the matter are ignored.  Amazon doesn't even pretend to care about its employees. The company will chew you up and spit you out to be replaced by the next college graduate to go through the wringer. Essentially everyone in the company is in an oncall rotation, and be prepared to be oncall even when you're not "oncall" if you've become one of the more senior member on the team due to Amazon's legendary attrition rates.  Amazon is a decent place to develop your skills, but almost every group is a fast track to being burned out and run ragged by management.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Microsoft is changing Many of the people are extremely talented. If you put the time in to connect with people you can get a broader view of how the company is doing. Some groups at Microsoft encourage and reward people for being creative and improving the way your team works. Microsoft is in a very competitive landscape, and they are struggling to keep up with the competition. The entire company has been going through a protracted reorganization, which causes teams to lose focus and direction. It can be hard to get things done in the current environment, but perhaps after all the dust settles the changes will pay off.

Inexperienced Managers Make Work Rough Exciting work and lots of opportunities for learning. Inexperienced managers have a tough time actually managing people. Lack of communication between management and their direct reports cause a toxic environment and reduces productivity.

Easy Job Working at the Apple store is an easy job. It's air conditioned, the store is clean and the air is always fresh. The management strives to be mentors, you get praise when you do well.

Great opportunities, Great environment, terrible review system and bad managers In 10 years working in Finance roles at Redmond the best things are great opportunities (working in different locations around the world and in different roles supporting various business groups), great business partners, working with great employees. Lots of fun activities to participate in (sports and various games on campus). Terrible review system - forced distribution that is solely based on sucking up to management chain which I refuse to do. Every year I receive tons of great business partner feedback but get an average review. I get promoted (from level 57 to level 62 in 10 yrs financial analyst to finance controller) and continue to get good opportunities but that's because of the business partners and people knowing my strong work ethic but I always get average ratings which is super frustrating (Reason for looking on this site for a new job). I don't put in 55 hrs/week and give excellent support to my business partners for average review ratings (which results in target stock award of apx 10% and target bonus of 10%). The 55 hrs/week is average (ranges from 35 - 80 depending on time of year and specific job). In 10 yrs I've had 12 managers. Lots of turnover (people moving to new roles) due to bad review system - need to get a new job to get promoted. Most managers tend to push everything down and their role is unnecessary.	0.2025354477312408	0.2176760459691122	0.23166569036887577	0.2301231168152065	0.11799969911556467

My experience at the Microsoft Store has been that of a rollercoaster. Good pay, benefits, and opportunities, such as networking and being apart of influential events. Benefits include medical coverage and tuition reimbursement for even part timers. Inconsistency between managers and lack of structure and discipline.

Senior Software Engineer Inside google, it very very easy to change projects for whatever reason as long as you have been in the current team for more than one year and got no performance ratings of "need improvement".

great benefits, youth culture outstanding benefits, good people overall One thing I noticed was the first person to 'post' an idea ultimately gets credit for the idea, even if they didn't originate it. Makes it hard to discuss ideas or work collaboratively without fear that your ideas will get stolen. I guess it's part of moving fast and breaking things. Also, propaganda posters decorate all the buildings. They're there for inspiration but it felt more like cultish brainwashing. My opinions could be because I was older than about 92% or the population at Menlo Park which skews toward college grads and under 30s. For a veteran of the industry, some of the soft and sentimental "stories" sometimes ring false. Some people simply want to go to work and do a job without having to make it a life changing experience.	0.18771023778974044	0.18779356427778576	0.21811252920543966	0.2364637940438364	0.16991987468319775
Great organization You can't beat it. I worked here for a year, in one of the smaller east coast offices.

SDE Acceptable if this is your first job 1. Most of the good engineers left. 2. Some senior engineers DONOT know their team's services. 3. Projects are boring. Writing code is NOT your job. Your job is to solving stupid tickets. 4. Management is chaos 5. Around 50% people will left after 1 year. 6. You will take a long time to learn how to set up environment and do testing. But unfortunately, those things are useless in other companies. 7.

Some great employees to work with but management is awful. - Good salary - They employ quite a specific type of person so it's easy to get on with the majority of other employees - Good discount on Apple products - Food/drinks supplied on special occasions - Quarterly meetings have a fun theme to them - Staff are treated like children and even though they are told they are able to make 'tough decisions' it rarely is allowed - Put pressure on sale of addons like Applecare and mobileMe, previously - Every Sunday there is 2 hours of 'training' which is very boring and rarely educational - Those chasing progress throughout the are usually destructive to the atmosphere and morale of the entire store. - Very few entry level employees work their way up to corporate levels, like they are promised. - Management will often put rules in place then undermine it when the staff take criticism from customers, making themselves look good but destroying the hard work the staff members do in explaining why policies exist.	0.1860251332720554	0.1473705601246153	0.25042443629767586	0.2598568929772062	0.1563229773284473

Underpaid, overworked, treated like crap The company itself is very good and provides good benefits and perks, including free products at certain times. At times the job involved playing XBOX and running fun workshops for kids. It's an excellent company to have on your resume, and there is some potential for using it as a springboard to a corporate position at Microsoft (although I cannot say how possible this really is). The pay for the position was laughably low given the requirements and expectations, and significantly lower than Microsoft's major competition. Many staff were temps brought on from agencies, who were strung along for months with no idea if/when they would ever be awarded full-time positions. Store management varied between absent, incompetent, childish, and downright awful human beings, and poisoned the working environment.	0.19676785975805172	0.1808457301488663	0.18677218951598976	0.266470647280575	0.16914357329651716

Good experience with some downsides -- Flexible scheduling lets you take care of things during the day if you need to -- Salary matches cost of living, so you can afford to live in the ultra-expensive Bay Area -- You get to learn new skills on the job since there are always training sessions available both in your department and in the company as a whole -- There's too much emphasis on quantifying results even when what you're trying to measure can't be boiled down to numbers -- There's a push to compete with other employees and a rush to get visibility in the department, which leads to an enormous amount of unnecessary presentations in meetings -- Some managers try to push you to move your career in a direction that you don't want to go -- There are limited promotions, so you have to move laterally in the company before you can move up	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375

Apple is a great company to work for. Benefits are still better than my friends who have much higher paying jobs. They can't be beat. Apple is pretty good at hiring people that fit the culture. It takes a long time for leadership to reprimand people who don't work hard and recognize the people that do. The attendance system is also very "grade level" - I've seen incredible people get fired because they were consistently "late" by 2-4 minutes. A time that other jobs I've had didn't care about and that doesn't effect our stores or teams negatively. Not having a grace period and/or respecting people as they are individually is a huge con. "I understand you exceed expectations in every way and are dedicated to helping the company succeed but those two minutes really effected your team negatively."

Genius Apple does know how to hire great people. I have made some great relationships. One word “Retail”. You work most holidays, weekends etc. Work - Life balance non-existent.

Past its prime and protecting the past Initially MSFT was a great place to work. Its sheer size and scale meant there were numerous interesting work challenges, a clear career path, international work opportunities and smart people to work with.The benefits were good and the pay fair. Microsoft's glory days are well behind it. The company has spent the last decade trying to protect the Windows franchise instead of embracing the true potential of the web and innovating for the future. The culture and working environment became quite toxic (although there are some good people there too) with colleagues competing against each other each review cycle. The mid level and senior management I worked with were completely focused on themselves and working the Microsoft system to their advantage rather than looking outward and taking care of their customers.	0.18937381431729697	0.19703922057432455	0.233671259460481	0.21616524841858645	0.16375045722931092
For those who love to Challenge Status Quo! What makes Amazon unlike any other employer is its relentless focus on the organization's Culture. This is not seen as just a responsibility of the "Management". Every employee who joins is encouraged to take ownership of the task and is also measured up by direct reports/peers/manager/leadership on how well they accomplish the same at the respective level they operate. With the Scale at with Amazon is growing in size, this element is critical in ensuring uniform employee experience. Competitive on salary, Employee friendly policies. Another key USP for Amazon is the talent group you work with. Almost all hires are high performing individuals which means the overall bar of performance is also high. This is good for those who want to take on challenging (in every essence of the word) tasks & constantly want to improve the status quo. Personally what stands out is how employees are encouraged to determine their own deliverables for the year and are measured not just on the end deliverables, but on what learning the initiatives brought and the quality of work put in. There is usually nobody micromanaging you or creating pressure on deadlines, the environment is such that you will yourself be compelled to deliver high quality work and reach out for help where you need. There is nobody creating pressure for you for timelines and quality of work, but due to the high performance culture prevalent, you would realize that you are stretching yourself with self determined goals. For those who do not do well with self management (although ample support is available if sought out) and a high performance culture, the overall environment would soon seem stressful even though it is brought upon by oneself.	0.16590547435845854	0.21067420840068168	0.18429813705621534	0.2498526745659173	0.18926950561872707

I truly enjoyed working for this company The company itself is amazing, the benefits, holidays, PTO can't complain. If you like meeting people this is an amazing job. In this role theres truly advancement opportunities as long as you can prove yourself. You are mainly dealing with 3rd party retailers. Meaning you have no authority to make any real decisions but you are still required to make them. You play a role where sometimes the in-store management team treats you like a store employee and not a partner (vendor). You don't deal with your own apple co-workers as much as you would like.	0.15108740582689592	0.2762814066254293	0.20629241949441585	0.21741172176757148	0.1489270462856874
Amazon will leave you hanging Pay, benefits, discount, some cool people, breaks Doesn't take care of employees when they run out of "points", even when you go to the hospital, they will fire you, even with a note.

The sky's the limit if you work hard Amazon is a place where people are encouraged to look for challenges to step up to. If you're hungry and nail these opportunities, there's always more, bigger ones to keep knocking down. Top talent at Amazon is rewarded extremely well. Everybody here is scary smart. The brightest can rise fast. As far as software companies go, Amazon is definitely top tier. Our technology is unbelievable, and you won't believe some of the awesome stuff we're working on. Benefits are just ok (probably more than offset by comp though). The environment can feel like a startup still in a few places around the company, but YMMV and you're more likely to find yourself in a division that feels corporatey. This is much less the case for engineers who are generally shielded from too much BS by their managers. Expect to work longer than 40 hours a week on most teams, in most roles. There can be slack times, but when launch approaches (or it's Q4 for anyone working near the retail website), you'll find yourself leaning in pretty hard for short bursts.	0.17562407919479203	0.21196760994474512	0.2071816066635636	0.2432253891578214	0.16200131503907794

Incredible culture and benefits Working for a mission-driven company makes for an engaged and enthusiastic workforce. Focus on impact means that you have flexibility to get work done when and how you choose. Quality of people we hire is outstanding, coupled with low egos. Love the 'focus on strengths' mentality which means your role often shifts to make sure you are spending the most time doing what you love. Lots of support and training for managers at FB, although the individual contributor role is equally valued - becoming a manager is a lateral move (and a deliberate choice) at FB rather than a reward for being awesome in an IC role. Personally I love the concept of bringing my authentic self to work and being personal friends with coworkers, but I understand that it's not for everyone. I do feel that this will become more prevalent as the millennial generation becomes the majority of the workforce in the next decade.	0.1957804832785068	0.22142714316686046	0.21642755368233732	0.19713383034645027	0.16923098952584506

Genius You will learn discipline out of necessity. You will learn how to multi-task out of necessity. You are already good at teamwork, otherwise you would't have been hired. But you will still learn how to be even better out of necessity. You can transfer from region to region quite easily. I moved a number of times while I worked for Apple, and was not only able to keep my job, but re-negotiate salary while transferring from region to region. The gestalt varies greatly from region to region. Some are better than others. However, even in the worst of them, I always found myself working with great people. Decent discounts on apple products for you and your friends and family. When you look for a new job, you can say that you were a "Technician at Apple" You were expected to give 130% effort at all time. Seriously! They figured out how much work you can do if you give 100% effort. They then devised a schedule that required we each gave 130% in order to meet the baseline demand for service. The company's rapid growth beginning with the launch of the iphone was always too many steps ahead of the growth of the retail service department. You are working for a tech company. You are a technician. Your management however is retail operations. Little room for upward mobility within the company unless you wish to go into retail management or move to California.	0.15890989976873576	0.20179091419537126	0.2388057485543773	0.19045857246668127	0.21003486501483443
Will deeply miss my time at Microsoft... Some of the most amazing tech industry leaders work for Microsoft, and you will feel their influence. Drives you to work harder, and better yourself. Access to the bleeding edge of patterns, practices, tools, technology, and thinking. You are given access to more training venues and opportunities than you will reasonably be able to take advantage of. If you want to learn more about any tech, this is the company for you. Given lots of freedom to maintain work/life balance (see caveat in Cons). Leading the way with cutting edge review processes that work toward keeping employees from being a number (we're still transforming this process, and it has it's quirks, but is . Company leadership as a whole truly care about your work life. They ask for lots of feedback, and I have personally witnessed the company change direction in a big way based on employee feedback. Benefits are about the best you'll get. In my particular division (Microsoft Services), you will get to meet LOTS of industry leaders, and power players at Microsoft and other big enterprises across the world. If you want to expand your network, this is one of the best jobs around. Wallflowers don't last long at this company. VERY high demands, which can cut into that work life balance. Nobody will ensure you have this balance, and it is up to you to maintain it. If you are passionate about technology, like I am, you may find yourself having difficulty choosing work/life balance over going that extra mile for your projects and team. There is ALWAYS more work to do, and the company will always welcome, and incentivize you to chose more work. Travel expectations can be unreasonable for a "family person" (although, not unreasonable from a business perspective). HUGE organization, so we do suffer from your typical Big Corp Problems: Communication difficulties, inter-departmental collaboration, business goals/objectives and their alignments at the separate business divisions are not always as tight as they should be, and of course, you do at times feel like a number but this is trending in a positive direction.	0.18971058352587297	0.23423922904783848	0.1963475890548056	0.1901276290997153	0.18957496927176767

A place to have an impact As a Software development manager at Amazon, I enjoy coming to work everyday knowing that my team's efforts are having a significant impact on the world's largest e-commerce site. I am talking in the xxx million dollar per year range. There is a lot of latitude in choosing how to work and the direction of your product. Every person I have met so far is quite bright and enjoyable to work with. Compensation is great especially compared to the broader, more legacy IT companies. Rapid/frequent organization change.

Stower During Peak Season - Full-time, 40+ hours - Pay slightly above minimum wage - Helping customers receive products as quickly and efficiently as possible I'd like to note before I start that I absolutely hated this job and would not do it long term no matter how much Amazon paid me. There were a couple people I knew that liked it, but they came from the construction industry and liked working at Amazon for the consistent pay and hours. Everyone else I knew disliked working in this position due to the impossible rate/quality expectations, the extreme boredom and the physical requirements. It is 100% impossible to comply with every company policy at the same time. For example - - You're expected to meet a RATE, where you have to stow a certain number of items per week. It's not a straightforward concept, as in 1000 items per day - each item has its own time limit/rate (something like - large items 30 per hour, medium items 60 per hour, small items 120 per hour), so it's not possible to personally calculate whether you're meeting the rate or not. Managers (or Problem Solvers) post a list of all working employee rates throughout the day, or sometimes once per day, and that's how you can figure out how well you're doing rate-wise. - There's also a QUALITY standard, where you're expected to stow about 1100 (or 1200?) items without making more than 1 error (according to the scanner). - And multiple rules on how items can be stored... as in items cannot be sticking out over the shelf more than the width of your badge, items cannot be more than 50% above the divider (between each shelf), all items on shelf must be visible, liquid items must be placed upright, etc. The warehouse looks like an episode of hoarders. The shelves are stuffed to the brim with items, and this requirement in and of itself would be physically impossible to meet. - Time off Task (TOT) - So as a shower, your job is to stow items out of 12 "totes" (storage bins), which are located on a large cart that you push around the warehouse. The time required to remove and replace the empty totes (and cart) back to the que, find out where the full carts are located, grab a cart, and push the cart to an aisle with as much space as you can find counts against your rate. It's not necessarily TOT, unless it takes you more than 6 minutes to do. However, if it does take you more than 6 minutes, or if you spend six minutes doing something else without scanning an item and scanning a shelf (such as using the bathroom which takes about 4 minutes round trip to get back and forth from, speaking with your manager or HR) you will accrue TOT.  The strict requirements of the position make it an extremely stressful job, especially (but not only) during the peak season. Also, as other people have pointed out, breaks are about 5 minutes, considering the time required to walk to and from the break room. These are only the most prominent cons and the ones that all stowers at the San Bernardino location will have to deal with.	0.1764500341414924	0.15242681972583133	0.15448014671264362	0.29856781689332784	0.21807518252670477

Leadership create unnecessary politics Salary, stock, US led events. Culture in other offices (apart from Australia) is really good. Good flexibility but the workload is really high so you cant always take advantage of it. Business class travel for long haul when you are senior. Insincere leadership that lacks authenticity in Australia. They are all too busy writing their own publicity and reading it. Culture in Australia not the same as other offices, is very political and it all starts & ends with the current MD. It is not a culture that embraces differences so if you want to join, be prepared to suck up to MD, adapt your communication style to 'their way', do lots of self promotion and get really good at understanding how to manipulate the scorecard to "look good" like the others.	0.1951582994865348	0.19524493224509173	0.20138066584299025	0.23155406106521598	0.1766620413601673

Great place to work! Great benefits, family oriented, decent work-life balance. This is a great company with tremendous resources, doing amazing work in the technology industry.

Awesome tools, great teammates The Microsoft internet divisions have a great separation between Dev/Ops (who make sure that the SCOPE/Cosmos/Dryad systems just work, though sometimes with long queue times) and the Big Data developers (who just need to write SQL-like SCOPE code with C# customizations, and schedule their jobs in the Æther graph-based scheduler). This lets developers focus on getting their jobs done. The task-planning system is scrum-based, with short cycle times.

How about coaching makes you feel like the worst and useless person instead motivate you to improve?, you come back to home and you wonder "what did i do wrong" Improved everything and two days later you have another wonderful coaching session where you hear : You don't fit here, you are fired.

Run Away... Far, Far Away Other than it's a paying job, there are no pros. I work for a PrimeNow location, and I advise anyone thinking about working for Amazon to look elsewhere. The company does not value its employees at all. They will keep you on a temporary basis, for 11 months at a time, so they don't have to offer you any benefits or PTO. There is zero management support, and in fact, will give you an attitude if you try to point out what is going wrong.

Will use your peers against you. Told to ask questions if you don't understand something, but don't answer your questions and rarely give good context. Coachings that are supposed to happen every week get pushed off for a few weeks to a month. No one is on the same page. Your job is on the line after the one day you are sick. There is definitely an attendance policy, regardless of what you hear.	0.15697844094047428	0.1945380849041895	0.20091325369912677	0.26562029664064757	0.18194992381556174

Excellent Culture and Management The culture with this company is one of a kind. Management invests time, thought, and effort in all of their employees. When working in an Apple retail store, it does not feel like retail. Apple gives you invaluable tools to succeed, and progress within the company, or to expand elsewhere. Although expected, working retail hours were not always that wonderful.

Experience totally based on supervisor. They have too much power Good work, good pay. Energetic environment. New technologies. Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX. However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day. He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could. He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical ! He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is "his word vs mine". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that. I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry. The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me.  I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.	0.23000214172062838	0.21139074900959784	0.18687444450597243	0.256043875878026	0.11568878888577533

Technical support is a sales position. I worked there for about two years doing technical support. For maybe the first year, it was pretty great. There was plenty of training, good benefits, pay was decent. Fixing customer problems was the main focus of the job, and I was doing very well at that. We also could sell items to customers, but that was just a useful way to order them a part or cable or disc they needed without having to shuffle them to a salesperson. Sales was not a focus. I wouldn't have taken the job otherwise, because I have no skill at all at sales, and it's something I absolutely loathe doing. After about a year, things changed. Suddenly technical support agents were pressured to make sales. Another month later and we had sales quotas we were expected to meet, though we earned no commission. Another month or so later, and sales was the main focus the call-center. All department or team meetings were now about sales, all discussions with management were about how to sell more, and any performance awards given out were for making sales. At one point my supervisor made her team fill out a form after any technical support call where they didn't make a sale, where we had to explained why we had failed to do our job... because SALES was our job now, the technical assistance was just something we had to do between pushing products on the callers.  Also, the entire Apple call-center had no windows. I always wondered if that was some kind of architecture-based pun.	0.20069050637129637	0.18445096268918304	0.1904955684131026	0.25184744390427943	0.17251551862213854

Very start up feel, strong talent calibre, and great culture that the management seeks to maintain.

Great Pay is exceptional for retail, the people are incredible, great avenues for development until you reach a senior role such as genius.

Huge sense of pride in representing the company each day. strongly agree with environmental goals and company's stance on consumer privacy. Once you reach this role, there are no avenues to advancement outside of leadership.

A great culture that allows a self-starting person has the freedom to take an idea and drive it to reality. Compensation, benefits, ability to drive change on a global scale, working with really smart people - most of whom really seem to care A terrible bureaucracy at times. Too many layers of direct and matrixed management. An enormous DISCONNECT at the middle management level between executive strategy and what's actually happening on the ground. Runs primary in the levels Sr. Director and General Managers, but occasionally hits CVP and Directors. Too much managing up, and not enough care given to support teams. Too much empire building and not enough doing what's right for One Microsoft. The irony is that even at the CEO level, the executives get it.

Tier 3 / TRA They pay above market averages and, provide great benefits. While they really sell their company culture, and constantly discuss using good judgement, they really want you to do things the way they think it should be done. Your good judgement is only good if you follow their opinion of good judgement. Even if you have a good reason to do something differently, its not okay.  Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once. not twice. Terminations are frequent, and abrupt. In the last 6-8 months they have termed 3 supervisors, and about 15-18 people. There is a higher than average rate of churn here.  While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees.  Earlier this year they also announced plans to change tier 1/2 support from internal netflix employees to contracted employees with a call center provider.	0.1487492449187399	0.1888884591942154	0.21938419312190593	0.27206754233769576	0.17091056042744293

Starting out at Amazon Great benefits and stock at a company whose stock has gone up by hundreds of dollars over the past 2 years. Can be great opportunities to apply new technologies and work on cutting edge products. Teams are very insulated so experience can vary drastically depending on what organization you end up in. However the guidelines surrounding performance evaluation are standardized across the company and can prove restrictive for individual managers. In my experience managers tend not to have time or resources to monitor individual performance and can't accurately assess individuals to help them improve or warn them until they are actually conducting performance reviews at which point corrective action is immediately required with limited flexibility.	0.18997811244694937	0.20552798239301306	0.1872691098675963	0.21676372348876896	0.2004610718036722

A great place to work as long as you stay ahead of the competition Few companies offer software engineers the opportunity to have such a global impact. Good team are amazing to be a part of. Line-level managers are often inexperienced, low quality, and too focused on their own ambitions to grow their team (who they often compete directly with for review scores). The review system is deeply flawed, which is fine as long as you are a top performer in your level band. The longer you stay at the company, the harder it is to stay ahead of this curve - beware.

Great place to work Google has a lot of really smart people who come to work with a great attitude of wanting to do the right thing and make people around them successful. We are lucky to have leadership invest in their employees and really want to make the world a better place. We very rarely approach projects in a "here is how we can save money" approach but more in a here is how we can make a great user experience. The perks are great and the atmosphere is really relaxed and empowered to make a positive impact. Compensation is definitely not the highest in the valley which makes it difficult to live close to work and buy a home you would really like to live in.  Sometimes it feels like there are too many cooks in the kitchen on high profile projects.  As we grow, the perks seem to be lessening. The food is not as good, the christmas present was definitely not as good and it feels like opportunities to feel apart of Google are starting to become more rare.	0.18539074866775637	0.2108440744968937	0.1996993096681328	0.20784202878734753	0.19622383837986954

What I would have talked at an exit interview (if I had one) Maybe it will look good on your resume. There are a lot of data and you may be able to do an interesting analysis (only if you are patient enough to wait for your query to run, see below). Work-life balance was not bad for me. There are a few smart and honest people. Almost everything I wanted to say is in this review by another "research scientist II" on Aug 11, 2014 (Glassdoor does not allow a link in the review, filter reviews with "research scientist II"). Noise level is terrible because of overcrowded office with ridiculously noisy SDEs who have no notion that there may be somebody who needs a quiet environment for his work. We don't have access to academic journals and conference papers, and we need to ask people in academia to get a copy, which I believe is against the policy of publishers. 3yr vesting of 401k matching contributions was what I did not know before I left and what I regret the most.  Amazon claims itself to be the world's most costumer-centric company. That in turn implies it does not care much about the employees. Basically, employees are dispensable and replaceable.  Company is not investing enough for its internal infrastructures, because they are not directly connected to customer satisfaction. Databases have much less processing capacity than what is needed, the situation worsened much more since 2013 and it is not a surprise if it takes more than a few hours to run a very simple SQL query. I wonder how people, especially data scientist type of people, do their work with such a poor environment.  Note that work environments for research scientists may be quite different depending on what area you are in. For machine learning and computer vision researchers, the company seems to be relaxing its strict policy on publications. However, on more traditional supply chain area that I was in, nothing seems to be changing, after all, we are probably not doing state-of-the-art research that is worth publishing. We are just coming up with ad-hoc patches for problems, without understanding anything and accumulating any knowledge.  Promotions are rare and it looks tougher for research scientists compared to SDEs. While SDEs have clearer measurements on their work, it is often unclear how to measure the contribution of research scientists' work. Management, which is dominated by MBA-type of people, does not understand the value of long-term research and they are only looking at short-term cost savings, which are often estimated based on dubious calculations using inaccurate financial figures.  There is no career path for research scientists. Internal transfers to other groups should be a good opportunity for employees to grow, but from my experiences, people are generally narrow-minded and reject you when you do not have past experiences in the exact area, even if you have good records of performance reviews. They basically treat you as just another external candidate.  One last thing. My employment was terminated 2 days after I submitted a formal letter of resignation, even though I was requesting to leave one week later. Not only I lost 1 week of income, I also lost health insurance coverage one month earlier, because I would have been covered until the end of month if I quitted in the beginning of the month as I planned, but they have "fired" me in the end of previous month and the insurance was terminated at the same time. I didn't even have an exit interview. I couldn't believe how badly the company treats me after more than 2 years of service. Beware, because this can happen to a person like me, who was performing well enough to get promoted just several months ago. This whole thing illustrates how the company disregards its employees.	0.22704211832287993	0.14545730763320044	0.1474167489948291	0.28491620352206354	0.195167621527027
Apple There are many great reasons to work for this company. The benefits are fantastic and the pay is very competitive. The cons of working for this company are many. If you want to have an opinion or idea to be heard then this company is not for you. The company often turns a deaf ear to anyone who is not from the walled gardens at their Cupertino campus. Management will pretend to listen to your ideas but your ideas will actually never reach the top and if they do make it there they will be passed over and be re-introduced at a later time as some one elses. If you are someone who does not want to fit into a cookie cutter mold then this company is not for you. While the company praises it's "unique nature", this is a facade. The company trains you like the military to act, think, and speak like a programmed robot. The company wants everyone to be the same and come from the same cookie cutter. If you are independent stay away from this company at all costs. If you do not live and breath Apple and are not a fan boy do not bother applying. This company does not value diversity in regards to ideas. If you do not think, act, and talk like everyone else this is not the place for you. Apple does not value differences. If you are fat, shot, ugly, or have any other outward awkward attributes that do not fit into their unspoken model, do not apply. The company is riddled with inept systems that are continually breaking down. The communication between executive management, mid level management, and employees is abysmal. I have worked for both sides of Apple (Corporate and Retail). The work life balance is horrible if you are working in the retail environment and if you are working it corporate it depends if your superior likes you or not.	0.17738587498668817	0.22525253575140694	0.18991898616079717	0.2671420908021403	0.14030051229896742

Becoming a research company. The company is growing and has recently increased the research staff significantly. Amazon is also unique in the size and scale of its operations from AWS to retail supply chains - you get data and problems that are an academic's dream.  The company is result driven, and there is a high pressure, but you learn a lot about things you would never imagine from outside. In my time here, I have worked on cutting edge research to writing terrible code that has been deployed across the company.  If you get on a good research team or important project, you can have a huge impact. It isn't really a research company - the typical academic (work on projects for months on end with no actual product) might find it a huge disappointment. There is no publishing mentality. Working on cutting-edge ideas is not encouraged if a heuristic or rule based approach is "good enough". Fancy theory doesn't impress anyone and doesn't give you credit unless it gets in to "production".  The infrastructure for research are bad. No access to journals and papers, no cleaned up and pretty data sets. You have to write database queries against an aging database that the whole company is fighting for time with. If you join a team with a lot of researchers, you are in luck. If you join a team as the sole researcher, your manager might ask you to plan "agile" research scrums.  The pay isn't enough to justify spending your Ph.D. on mundane projects. The company nickle-and-dimes you for everything, and benefits are almost non existent.	0.19038962279439753	0.2002377626499384	0.2081467806668361	0.21987157808550958	0.18135425580331835

Amazon Distribution Center - Position: Stower Good pay, good benefits, quick to hire on, regular schedule, lots of overtime from Nov-Dec, ability to move up in position. It is a good in between job if you need a job right now for 1 year or less that pays decently well and has benefits. Hard labor to the point of wearing very hard on the body and possibly requiring surgery. Long, hard labor 10 hour days make for a sleepy drive home which is dangerous. The pace of work is often very grueling where one has to work as quickly as possible for the entire 10 hour day. Only a 30 minute lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks. The atmosphere of the job is depressing, negative, and cut throat in order to obtain the necessary level of work each day and move up in position.	0.18588007865634198	0.21022981504215965	0.18985611893486448	0.22527350379978947	0.18876048356684438

Packer Decent pay, very good sign on bonus and referral bonus, paid time off, benefits from day 1. Impossible to get your numbers. When the line is down, your numbers go down. You have no control over that issue, but will get written up for it. This company is a revolving door for employees. If you want to make some extra cash for Christmas, then it's great, just prepare for long working hours (5 - 6 days per week / 12 hour shifts).

Seasonal Hiring process is fast. Fast money. 60 hour mandatory workweek during peak, not enough time for breaks or lunches. Employees look miserable, most were. To get in and out of the parking lot was a hassle. They hire hundreds of people but don't have enough room for them to eat lunch or take a break. It felt like we were cattle at most times. It's like high school in there and most people are rude and steal or dirty. The shelves and bins are stacked too full and things fall out at all times. Percentages aren't ideal. Most employees and managers cheat the system there to keep up or get where they are now. The job is ideal for college folks or those without families or goals. Damage aisles are a joke and disgusting.	0.20904085439400819	0.15633712490834833	0.21570584780155594	0.2296873050381413	0.18922886785794624

The Day 1 mindset. At the outset, I want to put a disclaimer that in case you find this outrageously positive in the tone of the feedback, it is actually and I might sound like I am obsessed with Amazon, because, well I might be. I will also take the opportunity to say that this feedback is purely my personal opinion and does not represent the company in any way. I am doing this voluntarily because I want to. I can only tell what I learnt newly and in spite of being in the industry for many years, I felt I have learnt so many things and maybe, for the first time, actually got to see how institutionalized certain things are, though they seem to be not really alien in concepts in other companies as well. To start with, metrics as a way to define, both the problem and the solution. The concept is certainly not new to most companies, but not in the form I have observed and learnt at Amazon. It actually becomes part of your DNA where you habitually do it and not as a top down mandate. This takes us to the next logical step where we define goals for yourself and the team. I have not seen where this is not the case. But again, its in the way it is done at Amazon. The way metrics are used to define these probably make a world of difference. Next comes the leadership principles that Amazon has so effectively come to represent. Come to think of it, why would we want to hire anyone who doesn’t already have these imbibed in himself or herself. The focus on strong technical knowledge along with testing a person in terms of their leadership skills during an interview itself makes people proud of themselves. This pride multiplies as we become interviewers ourselves. Again, typical of Amazon, you don’t qualify to become an interviewer yourself because you are now in Amazon. You go through a process called Making Great Hiring Decisions and for every interview, you have some one called a Bar Raiser who will ensure we are setting a relentlessly high standard in hiring. Again, no company will want to make poor hiring decisions, but not many have such a well defined mechanism to ensure so. And again, this ties back to what Jeff Bezos always maintained, ‘Good intentions don’t always work. Good mechanisms do’. The last thing is the quality of people you work with. You work with a lot of intelligent people around you and, the best thing about Amazon is the number of highly tenured employees you get to meet. Nobody is above details and expectedly so. It helps you be on your toes all the time. When people always talk in terms of the leadership principles, it seemed pretty odd to me initially, but, not unsurprisingly, became a habit with me too as these principles really form the foundation of Amazon. I haven’t talked a lot about the Amazon leadership principles in particular because this is about my experience and not really something that can easily be Googled for. Amazon can be very easily very overwhelming. The place hit me and I seemed lost for quite some time when I joined. For someone like a fresh college graduate coming in as a Software Development Engineer, it might not be very obvious because they don’t come with a baggage of things to unlearn. There are some very good processes for on boarding a new hire. But, seemed seldom used and people struggle a bit. Another con I have seen with Amazon is, again, not unique to Amazon is that people tend to misuse the system sometimes. The company has grown so big that the bar is not consistent across all teams.	0.17480671501361536	0.27677729877155766	0.21112314883039746	0.1949214181256175	0.14237141925881194

Good Pay and Benefits But Getting Very Bureaucratic and Political Great Perks! Great food, nice gym, on site medical, the SF office has amazing views and is a great place to show off to your friends and family. Plus it's Google, which everyone has heard of and respects.  The pay is as good as anyplace I have ever worked.  Mostly good coworkers: smart, hard working, motivated. But see below. Very slow moving bureaucracy. When I first started I was working on a new database roll out that should have taken 6 months and was still not done 3 years later.  Chaotic approach to project management: there is a semi-constant state of reorganization that goes on, with people and projects moved from office to office and continent to continent with no concern for how this impact efficiency.  Political evaluation process. Since everyone can rate anyone else and everyone is stacked ranked against anyone else, there is a motivation to stab people in the back. People don't tend to give proper credit to other people's work for the same reason. It makes for a competitive and not very nice environment within one's own team.  There is a lot of lip service for work/life balance but if you actually work 9 to 5 your coworkers will rate you down for it.	0.19695912764506737	0.21515104549038302	0.16124338941425406	0.25373384071832716	0.17291259673196835

Great Company, could be better in certain ways 1. I have exceptionally smart coworkers that I get to work with and its a privilege that I don't think I would get everywhere.  2. I get to work on new technologies. And multiple programming languages Objective C, Swift, Scala ....  3. I get to work on interesting, high impact projects that add true value to our customers.  4. My team is pretty process light and while agile and very little of the ceremony of Scrum. 1. Amazon leaderships make more tactical decisions than strategic, leading to less than ideal technical debt, designs and long term planning and product decisions.  2. Amazon is filled with type A personalities and is kind of bruising at times. You have to develop a thick skin or you would very soon start hating your jobs.  3. Leveling criteria becomes exponentially harder as you progress. A lot of senior technical talent feel either under appreciated and are often not given promotions when they deserve it.	0.17779107343075778	0.24373334341488248	0.2065868178142179	0.21094795959152354	0.16094080574861833

Product Manager Steep learning curve. You will get a chance to influence products that are being used by millions. Experience looks good on your resume. I would not recommend MBA's to join Amazon. There are a few roles out there which offer good experience but overall I would say 75% chances are that you will get disappointed with your experience. Talk to your colleagues (software and product) before taking up an offer.  The company is very political in director level and up. Contrary to what some say, I have experience it first hand.

Amazing company, but retail branch is flawed Company mission and vision is second to none. Benefits are amazing, flexibility for a retail job is unrivaled. You get to use the latest and greatest products and software. One of the best things about the company is that the larger corporation listens to its people out in the field to improve on products and services. Tons of opportunity to learn new things. Very little room for advancement because there are so few stores. There is almost no accountability unless they don't like you. Mixed messaging is common, but the bottom line is that you'll be expected to just do as you're told.	0.20122928518404595	0.12744521394989577	0.24303505916026635	0.26439914653525226	0.16389129517053966

It’s really cool I definitely agree that this job isn’t for everyone however, it is a warehouse job and that does mean physical labor. The turnover rate is high because a lot of new hires see early on it isn’t for them and that shouldn’t reflect negatively on Amazon, if anything I find it great that they hire in bulk, they seem to give everyone a chance which I know a lot of us need. It boggles my mind over these negative reviews, your employer created the rules...follow them or quit? It’s really that simple. Benefits rock, atmosphere is great, you do feel valued despite reading that we are just a “badge number,” in reality the badge numbers are crucial because if your family calls in for an emergency they NEED to know where you are to connect you as soon as possible. They only require 24 hour notice for vacation, you can take pto if you feel like leaving, break rooms are fantastic and a wide variety of food/drinks/etc. I would definitely encourage everyone to apply, you won’t know if you like it until you try. If you excel at your job you are noticed right away, even on the first day. Breaks could be longer 10-hour shifts are hard on your feet but honestly, stretch and get good shoes.	0.15149596624194037	0.1923763690579506	0.22343522034930638	0.25862594399947886	0.17406650035132393

It provides for the family The pay is decent, medical, dental & vision insurance are good, the time off options they give us are great. The mandatory overtime during peak season with a assigned extra day, even if that day absolutely doesn't work for you they don't give AF. Also the promotion process is scetchy. I've worked for Amazon twice the first time I put in for a promotion, went for a interview the managers looked at my training and experience and made a decision based off that. This go around employees are getting told "you have to tell good stories" in order to get promoted. There seems to be a lot of favoritism and nit picking.	0.19061075362385502	0.2019196723886254	0.19207820936464193	0.24284587243020006	0.17254549219267765
Managers, Get a Grip! Check out other reviews to find something good about Amazon or AWS. I hardly have any that is not stated in other reviews. Amazon is proud of being data driven and that is fine when the data is chosen correctly and applied wisely. Here are some examples of applying it wrongly, but still sticking to the point of "I am driven by data" crap.  A manager I worked for tracked individual story points delivered by members in sprints and used those points to compare and push developers for delivering more. It doesn't matter whether you were oncall during one of those 2 weeks sprints(and didn't work on sprint stories) or the other person worked 18 hours a day - you have to be on par. If you try to explain that is not how sprints should be treated and it is all about team effort - he would brand you as having incomplete understanding of scrum!  Another manager in Dublin uses the number of code commits/reviews you sent out to measure your delivery effectiveness. A code change or configuration change that takes 2 minutes is counted the same as a code change you would be working on for 4 days in introducing a new feature. I wish he had the backbone to publish his data driven logic of counting code commits to measure developer effectiveness to the wider developer community within the company and seek feedback.  All those measurements are done secretly by the way. There is no upfront notice of "this is what I am tracking to measure developer's delivery effectiveness" heads up. If you believe you are right about your data driven "developer effectiveness measure", why are you coy about it?	0.19026841952804419	0.20011028999400132	0.20865087955230566	0.21973160641556722	0.18123880451008173

think big company, hi tech start up... people will think that you are important as you work for APPLE . Impressive achievement on the CV even though ... It is basically a BIG white call centre, handling calls with angry customers, awkward customers and so on... Customers will put lots of pressure on you as they think that because they bought an Apple device, they own all the rights to get a proper decent working device .... and they think that even being out of warranty they deserve to get a new device without any fusses as they bought an expensive device at first and the list goes on. Basically , just do psychological work , trying all the day round to make the customer not keen to send you a bad evaluation as it will impact your work performance ... just completely non sense at all and mentally exhausting without having even taken into board the Hierarchy which is just ludicrous as when you consult a SUPERIOR as so called, this one hasn't any clues whatsoever	0.16331262954573347	0.20738169782778498	0.21389883932958786	0.227763171268299	0.1876436620285947
Small Business Feel - Get a lot done but don't spend any money Very collaborative environment, constructive meetings, serious customer focus, and amazing long term perspective. Nothing is done to make this quarter look better, it's allways for the long haul.

Companies like Google, Facebook and M$ provide much better compensation & employee benefits.	0.20164609312206908	0.16853434847439408	0.21427055653364926	0.21763031595836765	0.1979186859115199
Bad place to work Looks good on the resume, either to get into other companies later. Some smart people here. No work/life balance, sweat shop. Yes, they will wake you up at 2am in the middle of the night. Management truly doesn't care about their employees. Very bad culture, people talk behind your back. Very high turnover, most developers are still unfamiliar with the product they're working on.	0.17127757828047863	0.23890242503131434	0.23119761753870996	0.2154943423703685	0.14312803677912855
Genius Apple attracts some of the smartest, coolest, and nicest people you'll meet. They put up with a lot of garbage from customers to reassure them the product works the way it should. You help all different types of people from life from homeless to CEO and you can learn and develop and grow here to whatever you dream to become. It comes at a cost though. Helping all those people all day is brutal and will make you want to go home and not talk to anyone. It's draining, and they don't pay you enough. Management seems to be getting worse and worse in a tech city with lots of opportunity.	0.18738763749468842	0.2823071350708053	0.13674251854992125	0.26133926500958515	0.132223443875
Great Company, Smart People, Set Boundaries Very Smart People. Meritocracy. You can move your career very fast. Performance is far more important than degrees, experience, or time at the company. If you are smart and highly motivated, this company will accelerate your career. There are a lot of very smart and highly motivated people here. If you want to make okay money while just putting in empty hours, there is a company across the lake for that. If you come here, you'd better be prepared to fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run.	0.11413720173887397	0.2153306224312011	0.23520916099699893	0.24198263440823728	0.1933403804246888

Bright people who are fun to work with in very high-performance culture Walk the walk consistent with the well-articulated culture. Very focused. Clear, well-articulated strategy with very good execution against it. Very transparent, both internally and externally. A bit of a culture of fear articulated as "the sniper in the building" as some new hires and long-time employees are either bad fit or fail to grow, and are subsequently let go. Culture emphasizes experimentation, which includes needed organizational experiments, and this type of experimentation also reinforces the fear. Again, most of this well-articulated in culture deck, so no surprise.	0.19038962279439753	0.2002377626499384	0.2081467806668361	0.21987157808550958	0.18135425580331835

Become Nobody at Amazon Umm... It shouldn't be this hard to think of SOMETHING. I guess the hire process is easier than anything I've ever experienced. You aren't interviewed. You go online to set up a time to go in for them to get your pertinent info, do a drug test, and get your consent to do a background check. You are hired solely based on that. As long as you pass the drug test and background is satisfactory, you're good to go. The benefits are good too. Awful pay. Leadership is completely detached. Employee evaluation is based exclusively on a flawed system of quantity, which is extremely vulnerable to abuse by lazy employees and is incapable of recognizing outstanding effort. Long story short, don't try to over-achieve here. It will absolutely not be recognized. Also, advancement is almost impossible. At least where I was. The best chance is being open to transfer elsewhere, which is unrealistic for most people.	0.17430694824908863	0.19714063903920634	0.2087691396366169	0.24277525759329402	0.17700801548179415

Poor company / vendor rapport at MARCOM - Free Jolly Ranchers and/or Life Savers at the reception desk. - Free drip coffee and distilled water. - Free dinner (compensation for no paid overtime) - The longest commute from the Bay Area - Awful company / vendor rapport: vendor employees are treated like second-class citizens and excluded from most Apple employee activities.

For Hub Manager -Great Pay, but zero job security or training, or stability. - Pay - Challenge - Can't think of another. - Nature of the position was not presented accurately before hiring. (they sold it as an HR position, but it was a glorified mechanic/ops manager job). - The turnover is insane. Out of about 65 hubs (at the time), there were about 6 emails about managers who were terminated my first week. That rate was very common. - There is absolutely no training or assistance if you need it. - You are viewed as a commodity. - They feel (and they'll tell you so!) that they can pay you a lot so you can produce fabulous results no matter what. - They fire people for no reason. I believe during the economic downturn maybe they fired a lot of management to replace with cheaper managers, but that may have even been going on before I got there. - They wanted to penalize me for having too many cracked discs in my hub, but couldn't find anything my employees or myself were doing wrong. Offerred no helpful advice, etc. Said we were doing great. Got canned anyway.

Microsoft pros and cons Well paid, good healthcare benefits (though definitely not as good as a few years ago), technically challenging  If you work there you will learn a LOT and to stay working there you have to be adaptable and able to learn new things quickly. Your job description will be a fraction of the work that you actually do. Some teams are fabulous and management is fabulous and others are, well, NOT. You have to find the right spot for you. Difficulty maintaining work/life balance. While your pay is high, you're often on the clock even at home (email, nighttime phone calls to other locations etc).  Depending on the team you work for, Microsoft can be very sluggish to respond to market needs. There's still a sense of fiefdoms and intransigence to new ideas. There are many long-timers there (though many were laid off recently). So, people who have less time in aren't given as much respect. It can be a very, very tough place to work when you get down to the wire and are close to a product release. Lots and lots and lots of overtime during this period.	0.18746702928758952	0.19505525337478954	0.21568364708811416	0.21398870325518313	0.18780536699432362

Good place to work, great work-life balance Microsoft is a great place to work, and the benefits are top-notch, especially for families. The company offers great work-life balance for those who want it. The work itself can range from boring to very interesting depending on the team that you join. Regardless though, you'll be working with some of the smartest people you'll ever meet. Like any large organization, Microsoft has its fair share of internal office politics and bureaucracy, which can slow down the product development process. Also, there's a lot of variation between orgs and teams at Microsoft, so two people's experiences of the place can be completely different depending on the team that they join.	0.19866394335825027	0.19555261340947164	0.23585898062873217	0.23829121809553022	0.13163324450801578

Stressful!! Benefits are not too bad. In the fulfillment center if you are working with filling orders (which is practically everyone) management pushes you hourly to keep up your quotas. That is what they are all about, just keeping your numbers up. And if you don't, they will give you a write up for lacking productivity. Also your name & numbers gets announced to everyone over the intercom. Talk about stressful.	0.2092374788555606	0.1986224509892459	0.15268701935876777	0.29181204089902035	0.14764100989740545
A double-edged sword * Pay rate was fantastic! Apple is hard to beat when it comes to them treating employees well from the pay rate and benefits included. Various perks for healthcare, 401K plans and other stock options, and other perks such as free software were really nice and helped employees feel more valued as opposed to just feeling like a number.  * Discounts on Apple products and services (consisting of various set percentage discounts and one-time per 3 year discounts to get an even larger discount, really helps a lot when you want something new and shiny :) ).  * Hours for work were almost always readily available - there are practically a near endless amount of overtime hour options available, and especially so during the holiday seasons or peak times such as a new product or major software update launch.  * Being able to work from home is a huge perk! You never have to worry about any kind of dress code or commuting costs. In addition, Apple will reimburse you for your phone and internet bills monthly!  * Apple regularly sends little freebie gifts to employees every few months or so. It's a really good feeling to open your mailbox and randomly receive a free gift such as a t-shirt, coffee mug, or jacket.  * While you may not have a guaranteed job, as employees are regularly reviewed yearly on performance metrics, if you are able to meet these jobs there are certainly opportunities available for you. Those opportunities may manifest themselves as either job extensions in your current position, a pay raise, or perhaps a promotion to an entirely new role. One thing that I am happy to see Apple do is promote existing employees within their company rather than just look outward to find a candidate.  * In a given work day as an employee, you usually learn something new. Even if you don't expect yourself to learn something a new, a new situation or customer type might throw your brain for a loop. I consider this element of uncertainty a positive, as I like taking on challenges and learning new things in the process. * Metrics performance goals are *FAR* too highly focused on and too micromanaged - you can be a fantastic employee at Apple, but if your metric numbers even look a little bit off in one area, expect to receive lengthy coaching from your manager. Management needs to realize that these numbers are largely out of control of the advisor, as the customer is the person with the ultimate say and can issue a rating that may or may not be appropriate for any or no given reason. In addition, metrics performance became practically impossible to achieve once management started issuing additional roles for the existing employees. For example - initially our team started off as T1 iOS advisors, where we would solely troubleshoot and help issues related to iOS-based products for the most part. However, over time once promotions came down the line, at the T2 level you are expected to act as a 'final point of contact' for customers regardless of their issue in the majority of situations. In addition, you take on additional products and services that you must be familiar with, and internal information is constantly being changed and updated which may lead to a different protocol for approaching certain issues. Not only that, but over time they expected all iOS advisors to be cross trained for Mac computer products as well - guess what that ended up doing? It ended up making every advisor be expected to know literally *everything* about practically every product and service, while drastically increasing the workload in any given day to the point where you never had a chance to take a breather. The T2 advisors were also being forwarded blind calls from T1 advisors, so these last two points significantly added onto the burden of the employee to the point where it becomes too much to handle.  * Forget about having any kind of work/life balance. At Apple, your primary focus is always expected to be about the job and nothing else. Expect emails from management or pressure from your team manager to take on additional hours. While management will sometimes issue contests based on employees who take on additional hours, they are completely random as you would expect (given that there are thousands of employees on shift at any given time). In addition, your work schedule typically changes every 3 months in the role. Every 3 months, you will have to submit a new shift bid and *hopefully* get the appropriate days and times you're looking for.  * At the T2 level especially, customers often tended to be rude. At the T1 level when I initially started off this issue was negated somewhat due to the larger influx of calls, but rude customers are to be expected in a customer service/technical support based role. To be fair, quite a few customers are also enjoyable to speak with. :)  * This last point may or may not be an issue for employees, depending on the team that you are randomly placed into - during complex or difficult situations during a call, you may or may not be able to rely on support from your fellow team members/manager. Again, this point can be either a pro or con depending on the situation for the employee (I had both variants happen throughout my tenure at Apple).	0.1668087918890939	0.14409820759554984	0.21349490365219512	0.2822540504186211	0.19334404644453992

Best place to Work! At Google , the employees can have free food during lunch . So we can get to know our coworkers more. We have a very friendly work environment at google . Google has its own implementations of everything. It's a highly competitive environment. The reward system is strongly biased toward "launches." There's a lot of peer pressure to spend a lot of time at the office because everyone else is spending time at the office. It's becoming harder to move up at Google. Supervision is minimal—but that cuts both ways. Google's remote-office experience is pretty lame. Pay is good—for engineers. Software engineers make more than $100,000 on average.  But startups are trying to steal engineers away from Google, and while they can't always match pay, they can offer more upside in their stock packages.  And if you're not an engineer, chances are your pay package won't be nearly as competitive	0.2265277166106997	0.28857279712010314	0.21833195566898483	0.06825637776822406	0.19831115283198836

Great benefits, impossible to get anything shipped. Fantastic benefits, good work load, not to overwhelming most of the time. My team was a very laidback, open team so i may have experienced something unique, or this may be the nature of design teams within Microsoft. Experiences may vary. Very hard to get any proper user experience work done, everything is looked at as "Is this really necessary?" A great deal of proper UX is destroyed and put to the way side because of costing. Thus, good design solutions continue to be buried and never see the light of day. Perhaps the reason so many Microsoft products have notoriously bad experiences.

Plain and simple - work here for a year and then get out! Resume builder and compensation package Please believe everything you see on Glassdoor about how awful Amazon is as an employer. I read those same reviews, and thought, I can work anywhere for 4 years. You will be treated like a number and nothing more. Push this button, fill in that spreadsheet. And, yes, I wrote spreadsheet. For a tech company, it is shocking how heavily their recruitment teams rely on spreadsheets. That alone should be a warning sign about how much (or little) respect recruiters are given. For a company that prides it's self on having "smart" employees, I reported to some of the worst managers in my entire career. All they taught me was how to kiss-up, lie, blame others, and cheat the numbers. In sum, stay away if you can. But, if you must give it a try, absolutely avoid the university programs recruiting team (tech, non-tech, MBA) and aim for an industry recruiting role.	0.2634448721854654	0.16322120490594627	0.1381567090554495	0.3157470639219586	0.11943014993118024

Great company but limited mobility Industry leader, on a ride after a few years of decline. Lots of smart people, challenges and global impact. Hard to find many other companies like MS. Culture is improving, more accountability and customer focus 100k+ people. Lot's of politics, particularly in Redmond. Lots of people can say no, sometimes is unclear who can actually say yes and has the resources to implement. Opportunities to advance are limited (career velocity has slowed down a lot).

Generally positive especially if looking for new experience Company is doing well. With right attitude one can acquire new sets of skills that can be useful down the road. Extremely political. Lots of red-tape. Managers do not seem to care about long term career of employees. Groups are compartmentalized and hence there is little cross-pollination. Very hard to know the big picture of how ones is work fits within overall company plan/products. Very hard to obtain internal transfers to work on other projects.	0.1907551415351816	0.21574349663055714	0.2108722378423084	0.2177419972540991	0.16488712673785375

The opposite of what Apple once aimed to be. Like in most other major employers, there are always really bright people. There are also really nice people to work with. Some people belong in both teams. Compensation is generally very good. In fact, it is above the market for some teams. If you are wondering why that is, you may want to read the "Cons" section. If you have watched Apple's 1984 Super Bowl commercial, then you know how Apple is. Apple has now become exactly that which it despised the most: the IBM of the 80's. The Establishment. The Big Brother.  Apple has grown old and both leadership and management want only to be worshiped, they only want to listen to praise. There are no dissenting voices, nobody from above likes that and Apple is famous for having the most tyrannical and ruthless HR departments in the industry, so don't dissent, and don't expect an ethical behavior if you do.  The amount of kool-aid that Apple employees are forced to drink on a daily basis only compares to the best (or worst) years of Facebook or Yahoo. And again, don't be a dissenting voice or your life will be made hell.  Of course, your mileage may vary. Since Apple is so extremely fractured and isolated internally, there must be lucky pockets where things are better. The large majority is not, however.  Internal mobility is nonexistent.	0.13430692955504964	0.1983956162287661	0.11036073281267667	0.44144293125070655	0.11549379015280115

Exciting place to work Got to work with a large range of really strong, interesting people. I ended up wanting to stay and work late because most of the people I worked with were a lot of fun. It was great working with highly motivated individuals that wanted to change the world. Way more politics that I ever imagined. Many people referred to management as Game of Thrones, since everyone vying for the top, inevitably died (got fired). There was often a mismatch between what the execs prioritized and what middle management wanted. Lots of koolaide drinking going on, and the focus on new features is so high while the attention to fixing broken things was really low.	0.20388704136920816	0.21213990889618187	0.20237666222395903	0.20529642561940517	0.17629996189124555

Amazon is great on focusing on right things Teams focus on real customer problems. Amazon allows engineers to do the right thing by focusing on the customer problems. Teams can work independently without many dependencies across the company. Sometimes it is a lot of work to keep a service running and it can be stressful. Team can however address this itself, so you can't really blame company if you didn't do good work in building your service.	0.18106309175908333	0.20478181721586522	0.20015806149499385	0.23012817707631783	0.1838688524537398

Great place to learn! Great place to learn new technologies. Amazon builds a lot of tools that are then used by software developers across the world. Working with Amazon, you get the opportunity to learn on all such cutting edge technologies before anyone else. So, if you are passionate about learning, then this is the place to be. Further, it is a very employee friendly company, where feedback from employees is taken very seriously and action taken.

Strong pay and benefits but soul crushing As a company Microsoft has great benefits and good pay. It’s a beautiful campus (soccer and softball fields, sand volleyball courts, trails etc…). Microsoft also has a lot of products. It is one of the few companies where you can work on an OS, developer tools, database engines, cloud services and games. If you get tired of working on one product you can move teams to work on something entirely different. You also get the opportunity to work with really smart people who have the same passion and technical interests that you do. Building software is Microsoft’s business. It’s not an IT or hardware shop it is a software company. Management is not honest or open. I found out about a change in my position\team structure by seeing an email distribution list. My manager at the time could not be bothered to tell me I had to make an appointment with him to find out. You can be surprised in your reviews. Very clique’ ish, if you are not in the same clique’ as you manager get out of that team and find a new one. There are way too many managers who can not write code, although they like to think they can.  Managers can be very demeaning to individuals. I had one manager tell me that the best management book he had ever read was a book on raising children. Even the current CEO, Satya Nadella, has made a similar reference. This is very insulting. I’m an adult you should treat me like one.  Microsoft is not an innovative company. When I joined the company the industry was reading books explain how Microsoft ships software. Of course the industry has passed Microsoft by and now Microsoft is not even mentioned in article that describe the direction the industry is taking.	0.14421248159731043	0.18312747375874794	0.2167188429975061	0.21718315427630183	0.2387580473701338

Area Manager For the most part, you are in control of what you are doing. You don't get micromanaged a lot. At the end of the day you will be able to see if you won or lost based on how you ran the shift and what variables you had to deal with. There is not a lot of bureaucracy or red tape and things move very quickly. The day also goes by very fast. You walk out the door at the end of the day knowing exactly what you accomplished.  Salary is pretty good. Opportunities for advancement do exist and it doesn't take forever to have a chance at moving up. Lots of other opportunities for lateral movement in between different departments. Also lots of opportunity to move around the country if you like to relocate. You get to learn a lot very quickly. They encourage movement from one job to the next.  Interacting with the associates can be challenging but you can develop some good relationships and help them succeed. The problem though is that there is very little room for them to move upward and most of them realize it so it can be a challenge to motivate them.  There are lots of weeks where you get 3 days off. Most area managers work Weds to Sat or Sun to Weds outside of Peak. Unless mandatory OT is called for the associates you will usually get 3 days off which helps you recover from the intensity of the work week. The area manager job is seen by most in the FC as the most difficult job at the entire company. Work/Life balance is extremely challenging. During Peak, there is none. You will work over 60 hours per week at a minimum, sometimes up to 70. For 2 months straight the alarm clock was going off at 330am to make it in to work a 13 to 14 hour day, 5 days per week. It can get very mentally and physically exhausting. I usually got one hour a day to see my wife when I got home before I had to quickly eat dinner and get to bed to do it all over again. Outside of Peak it is not nearly as bad but it is still a challenge. Outside of peak you will work 50 hours per week at a minimum. You will be on your feet 90% of the shift, walking around on concrete pushing your "desk" on a plastic cart. Your desk is a laptop. There is very little time to do projects or think creatively because of the intensity or chaos of the daily shift. You will walk a lot, usually 5 to 10 miles per shift depending on what is going on.  You have to make tons of split second decisions throughout the day which can also wear you down mentally. There are probably 20 different jobs associates are able to do and there are many jobs lots of them don't want to do. So basically everyday you have to deal with people complaining to you about why they are put into this job or that job and how you as the manager favor one associate over the other, etc. This is endless. The culture of FC management towards associates at Amazon is really weird. You aren't really allowed to discipline associates properly and they are given a million chances before they are terminated. They know they can go crying to the HR department who almost always sides with the associates. So, you are put in a position where you have to be very passive aggressive in managing them to improve their performance. You have to help "remove barriers" for them when in reality, the major barrier for most of the ones that are problems for you is that they are lazy and don't want to work hard, yet you can't tell that to them in a direct way because that will come off as "abusive" towards the associate. It is really strange. You will wind up feeling a lot of times that the upper management at each FC cares more about the hourly associates well being than they do your own even though you have to work way harder than the hourly associates do.  You are required to provide "feedback" to the majority of associates you manage, every week. You will manage about 100 people. Most of the feedback is negative because they had quality errors or did not make productivity rates, so you have to have a lot of difficult conversations all the time. In addition to running the shift you have to deliver probably 50 feedbacks per week, every week. This is constant. It gets old.  You are required to give 2 daily standup speeches to your department in front of about 100 people which last about 3 minutes. Be sure you are ok with public speaking.  There is very little training. You are really put over the deep end of the pool and they let you go and see if you can swim. If you are not comfortable with an ambiguous work environment and don't have tough skin this is not for you.  The overall culture is not that good. A lot of the stuff in the NY Times article is pretty accurate. Rarely are you given thanks for working your tail off, if you succeed at 9 things and fail at 1 the conversation will usually be about how you screwed up that one thing.  Bottom line is that there is a lot of room for growth and lots of different work opportunities doing many different things but you do have to deal with a lot of difficulties and stresses and have to sacrifice your home life. No matter what, working here you will learn everything there is to know about warehousing and distribution and it will look great on your resume if you perform well and you decide to leave. If you can make it a couple years you have a good chance at being promoted and make really good money.	0.15056571070092067	0.2166026446190946	0.27594569086784665	0.25476943522106843	0.10211651859106957

One of the most stressful and unfair environments you can imagine Good salary, good benefits, flexible schedule. Some interesting projects In the Senior bands and above, insanely unfair performance reviews. It all depends on how much the boss likes you. Seldom any relationship to value. There is plenty back-stabbing and tripping of fellow coworkers. If you are a woman, don't bother. There is a class action law suit pending, and it was filed for good reason. Even when you go for someone who likes you there are reorgs every few months and you end up working on something that you have no experience for, with no time to ramp up. I worked there 15 years, it is disgusting to see how differently bad the company is from when I started.	0.19038962279439753	0.2002377626499384	0.2081467806668361	0.21987157808550958	0.18135425580331835
Family Room Specialist While at Apple, I had the privilege to work with the best co-workers on the planet. Though it could be challenging at times, each store that I worked at offered an exciting and encouraging work environment. Especially when I was working in the UK, I found that management was very encouraging and even coached me on how to better my self and further my career with Apple. Hectic and stressful don't even come close to describing the work conditions at peak times. Things definitely started to change: initially it was all about 'repairing relationships' and that was very loosely defined, leaving more options open for us in serving customers, later, things became much more concrete, and, sadly, this felt like it was about the money sometimes.	0.19553194288377382	0.20344661569021968	0.19408345765009533	0.2378626278953648	0.16907535588054626

Interesting work, frustrating experience The subject matter to work on at the company is extremely interesting and you have the opportunity to try innovative solutions to problems if you can back them up with data. Working at Amazon is all about the dates. Once the dates are set, management is willing to cut any corner in order to meet them, which leads to technical debt and lots of legacy code and tribal knowledge about shortcuts taken. Also, you must take personal responsibility for your work life balance. You will always have too much work to do to have a reasonable balance, so set your own boundaries with management or 50 hour weeks quickly become 60.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Get what you give. If you have good work ethics, than you'll be fine. Great medical plans, stock options, 401k, maternity and paternity leave. 3 days off per week most of the year.

Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are. The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.  -Unbelievable benefits and compensation. Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing. Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a "baby bonus"), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on. - Strong company culture and values. I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely. Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, "Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?". Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident, there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the "#shiplove" mantra is strong here. -Work/life balance. You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here. I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends. -Facilities. It's Facebook! The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors. Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk. -Efficient and fast. Fewer politics than many other companies of this size. A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system. -The future! These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff. Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool. -Women's leadership. I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams). They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a "Managing Bias" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering. They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most. -Entitlement. After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled. I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open feedback ("feedback is a gift") occasionally breeds inane complaints in internal communication groups. -That commute. If you live in SF, you'll have to hike down to Menlo Park, and depending upon where you're coming from and how bad traffic is that day, it could be as bad as 2 hours each day. The good news: that's rare, and company-provided transportation options (shuttles with WiFi) make this as easy as possible. You do get used to it, and your time on the shuttle is your own. Sure, you can do work, but you can also nap, watch Netflix, or read.	0.19463614266238766	0.21428041367982711	0.20230709652025802	0.19516392606527563	0.19361242107225166

Overall, worth it. Co-workers were by and large the greatest aspect of working for Apple. They do a great job of hiring awesome, intelligent, hard-working individuals. Also just a great environment if you like helping people but don't mind the occasional tough cookie who is hell-bent on giving you a hard time. Most customers are extremely grateful for your knowledge and help. It can be tough to move to different positions. Sometimes it felt like there were manager favorites that would get all the opportunities to move around. When the store is busy, it can be chaotic and stressful working with customers you want to give your all but have the eyes of many waiting customers staring laser beams into your soul.	0.18934201873024673	0.21533783637767712	0.17015847254791186	0.21513259028170933	0.210029082062455

Performance is closely monitored on a weekly basis The main pro about the reserve customer service associates is the flexibility and the ability to make your own schedule as well as to work from your home. As a customer service associate you take phone calls via computer. You are monitored by the response you receive from the callers as to whether you helped them or not. Sometimes there is nothing you can do to affect this. It can be a company policy that you are the messenger of, and the customer is not happy and grades you harshly.

Great place to work if it aligns with your career goals. Lots of resources, career mobility and strong investments in employee development. Product quality is high, pricing and policies are transparent. Limited travel in most roles is good for family life. Low innovation value for customers. Intensely political and bureaucratic.

Learning Specialist Great Benefits and the company genuinely cares about its employees. I have never worked for a company that puts so much focus on its employees at every level.

Be a cog There are enough free food, amenities, and parties that you never need leave campus. Everybody is friendly. Lots of things to work on. All housing near HQ is priced for the top wage earners at Google so you can't buy a house and renting will eat your entire paycheck. Google's coding environment is designed for the lowest common denominator and twisted to support a nearly infinitely large codebase. 95% of your time will be waiting for spaghetti code to build, fighting code review trolls, following Google code style, trying to figure out bone-headed non-standard architectures, debugging your Google-modified world, wading through endless obsolete documents, and dealing with the politics of egomaniacs pushing their dumb new framework/storage/language/whatever in an attempt to gain recognition within a nearly infinite megacorp. Google uses almost nothing from the outside world so almost nothing learned can be applied to your career elsewhere. There are insufferable KoolAid guzzlers saying they love the "startup culture," as if it was normal to write 100 lines of code in a day, wait a week for it to be committed, and then attend a party of 1000 strangers texting while a computerized DJ blasts retro pop music. For all of this effort, regardless of the official project title, what you're really doing is enabling the creepy collection of marketing data.	0.24910466815221838	0.18834273383336575	0.19426156013330156	0.25243438617155256	0.11585665170956178
In the beginning I felt Honored, at the end Disappointed Pay at Amazon is great. I have worked with several customer service teams and their customer service model is by far the greatest model I have ever supported. I was with Amazon 3 years. Amazon is loyal to their customers and down right disrespectful to their employees. After 9 months on my team, I knew Amazon wasn't for me.  My first year with Amazon was pure chaos. I was there almost 4 years and my team had a re-org at least 4 times. I had four managers within the 3years I was with Amazon. I counted 18 people who were hired when I was hired and left within the first 2 years.  I have read other reviews about Amazon and they are spot on. I am one of the many that was places on a PIP because my manager had to pick someone. I was never informed that my performance was below par nor was I informed that my performance was being going to be evaluated against my peers. The metrics used to evaluate my performance were never presented to me, nor was I aware of what elements of my daily work, project work, and goals counted towards my overall performance. Although I was apart of a team I was basically an individual contributor and supported my programs alone. No level of expectations were ever set, I had no clue what to expect from my end of the year review. I achieved all of the requirements of my PIP and survived another year. Then after 6 months my new manager put me on a PIP again because they were concerned that I was not behaving like a level 5 employee.  I left Amazon before I even found another job, it was that bad for me. I rather deal with no benefits (which weren't that great any way) than deal with scrutiny I dealt with. I worked hard to get to the salary I was receiving at Amazon but it just wasn't worth it. When I was struggling with my relationship with my manager I went to HR to seek advice. The SR. HR rep said, well since your on a PIP my only recommendation is to seek employment outside of Amazon.  Ones success at Amazon is based upon who their manager. It is a popularity contest and if you don't play the game right, you lose.	0.25016665122800985	0.12568730171820972	0.19813529208621444	0.2461914730801107	0.1798192818874553
No direction, heavy structure Microsoft offers excellent benefits, let you have flexible schedules improving your work-life balance. HR does an amazing job at taking care of you. The company makes it easy to transfer between the various groups. Your opinion is not taken into consideration, direction changes with management. Doing a good product doesn't seem a priority. Promotions is the only motivation of management. There is no sharing between the various parts of the company, which rather compete with one another.	0.11857173811494122	0.28513208743389745	0.17480047499509468	0.2677977720368197	0.15369792741924704

Most stupid projects/technologies for software engineers Most the campus hires are very talented which strongly contracts the overall team. The working condition is above average in China. The engineering culture are stupid. Microsoft has the most ineffective tools I ever known. Most of the tools far are more trouble than they worth. Almost for everyone in the 30-engineers team,the projects are completely meaningless. Long time exposure to them will only make an engineer more stupid. My dev lead was an middle aged loser who religiously follow old technology from companies SAP. He had been constantly playing dirty politics and made himself a fool around everyone in the team. Overall, the management emphasize on your age or diplomacy more than anything else. I doubt whether it's because that's all they got or they simply didn't understand how to evaluate engineers.	0.1904566337257424	0.2422398816913525	0.14120935564114734	0.2660472174718973	0.16004691146986033

Big name player in the industry Benefits are second only to amazon and google. Other companies in other industries do not come close with benefits. Excellent vision , mindset and leadership from the CEO Satya Nadella. In the field, for sales and services it is really all about hitting your numbers vs what the CEO says the bison is, which is being customer obsessed. Forcing customers to buy what you need them to buy to hit your sales numbers to get paid is not being customer obsessed it’s being obsessed with making money short term.	0.18302003727433938	0.20699511676196922	0.2023213870903954	0.22180733600067157	0.18585612287262443
Business Program Manager Great projects, strategic initiatives, progressive company and of course fantastic benefits. Very smart and driven people sexism and ageism in the workforce. If you complain, you are marked. constant change makes employees fearful and therefore less collaborative, more defensive and feeling as though "I must succeed at all costs". Review process has NOT changed. On paper yes, but not in reality. If you make many small impacts the work is dismissed for those who may drive one large project. Evaluations are not focused on holistic impact, peer reviews are selective, and can be excluded. process can be very subjective with no recourse. Basically, my experience was if you are sub-ordinate and do not have an engaged or support manager you literally are screwed.	0.19412907154841955	0.20417063903815458	0.19259396591284386	0.22419008287925357	0.18491624062132841

Resume Builder Opportunity is everywhere at amazon. Joining straight after college, it really molded me into a hard working professional. It helps you identify the type of manager you want to become and gives you insight on how a political corporate american company works. It gives you an experience you will not have working anywhere else. It is an intense work environment and forces you to adapt quickly. Success at this company is a mixture of luck, hard work and political talent. Pay is good and stock options are more plentiful the longer you work there. Being a manager that has worked here for 4 years I have seen enough managers leave that I have honestly lost count. It is not for the weak of heart. It is very political in a sense that you need to please all parties involved to get promoted. You quickly see your entire management team get replaced with new managers and overtime you gain so much knowledge that you know more than you boss and bosses boss and even your bosses bosses boss. You work 50-60 hour weeks and get paid for 40. You work 80+ hour weeks during peak. As an area manager you have the hardest job in the building and get micromanaged more than you would imagine. People make decisions without asking you and causes frustration. When working on projects there is red tape everywhere. It causes a self fulfilling legacy due to yearly being ranked against your peers which in turn directly reflects on your pay check. You can work months upon months breaking records and "holding down the fort" and not get a thank you.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Retail is unfortunately going downhill fast! Have met many people that are life long friends Benefits (401K, Great low cost insurance, RSU, Discount Stock, Fitness Reimbursement, Commuter Benefits, Discounts) Corporate Career Experiences are awesome! Pay - The pay is good for retail but not when you consider how much the company brings in annually, it's actually insulting if you crunch the numbers. The longer you work here, the worse you're treated - The apple juice will wear off as with any job and people that are beyond competent in their jobs and who excel will be overlooked for promotions/career experiences by new hires who kiss a**. Pay is also pretty equal for people that have been in a position for years with someone that was just hired. There is no reward for sticking with the company whatsoever. No Work/Life Balance - Operations always gets screwed over with the algorithms for shifts. People have preferences for shift times/days, give it to tenured employees first then fill with part-time as needed, as with most other companies. It doesn't make sense. Management is inept - Some are good but others almost make it their mission to throw their direct reports under the bus because they don't know what they are doing. This would be alleviated if management was hired from within, as well as from within departments. No real career mobility - It is near impossible to move forward unless you kiss a**, orgasm the "Apple culture" and management wants to sleep with you (which has happened at my store. Apple culture is deteriorating - This goes back to corporate. Everything is $$$ now at the expense of employees while top executives make a killing and gift us $5 T-shirts and a printing of the Apple Credo as a Christmas gift. The company could give every retail employee a $10,000 raise and it wouldn't even be more than 1% of their profits yearly.	0.10823208785861782	0.2555443957405496	0.15133363928891452	0.2963767953657598	0.18851308174615827

OK company, but not a great place for hardware engineers Pay is really good, benefits and total comp are pretty competitive. Cost of living is lower in WA than in CA. Easier workload than other hardware companies I've worked for. Organization in the hardware teams is nonexistent and has pretty bad leadership all the way up the chain of command. Lots of layoffs since joining (over 7,000 people from the Nokia acquisition, hundreds of others from Xbox, Surface Hub, etc.). People don't seem driven and put in minimal effort/hours. Many are just cruising with their high-pay, low-stress jobs and focusing their time on things outside of work. Have to use Microsoft technologies to get all your work done (Outlook/Sharepoint/OneDrive), none of which work well because they push the internal buggy versions to everyone's machines. No real "company culture" that I can identify with. The company is focused way more on software and the hardware engineering operations are kind of a joke.  Personally: project was canceled within three months of taking the job. The job I negotiated for was also not what I was placed into and management didn't seem to care. Ended up being a big step down on a technical level. There's an overall lack of any real challenge and, for most of my time here, a lack of any real work to do at all. Team was not prepared for my arrival -- couldn't log into computers, couldn't access emails, had no badge/couldn't access the building for four weeks and had to call coworkers to let me in after using the bathroom.

Good Job, Not for Me - Incredible ongoing training - Opportunities to work in other Apple stores for on a "passport experience" - Amazing coworkers - Discounts or deals on products - On-the-job conflict resolution training - Very streamlined system - At the end of the day, you are a retail employee with the responsibility of a technician. That combination works great for some people, but I found it unfulfilling. - In my experience, management went largely unchecked and corporate policies were used as ammunition rather than compliance guidelines. - Employees get yelled at a lot by customers, regardless of who (s)he is or what (s)he says. Ask any former or current employee: the stakes are high for Apple customers and being yelled at regularly simply comes with the territory. In defense of this, however, Apple has great training for conflict resolution.	0.19481781108611862	0.20938147507816496	0.20294083548465952	0.21841073187861534	0.1744491464724415

If you're a multitasking personality and enjoys attention to detail, then Genius Admin is the way to go. Overall great work environment. Management is very encouraging and truly want for you to succeed as an individual whether thats with Apple or outside of Apple Work/Life balance is sometimes difficult to keep. Apple retail management is always changing and that makes it hard to remain connected and build strong relationships with you leadership. For example they separate all the employees into groups and assign a single manager to oversee the development of that group. So if you so happen to get a manager who's focused on his own job and is very busy, then you're pretty much left to fend for yourself.	0.15972685997186062	0.20282832688325111	0.2146763224961357	0.24054771741744188	0.1822207732313107

Overtime, Overtime and Overtime. Very less positiveness to talk about. Forget about Work life balance. There is no personal life once you join Amazon. There is whole big list for the Cons however, I would like to talk about only few as of now. 1. Over Times, Over Times and Over Times. I have switched quite a few departments however, the only common thing I have found in Amazon.in is "Overtimes" and that too without any extra payment for those extra hours. Once in a blue moon is acceptable. However, it is round the year. Sometimes in the name of PEAK and every fortnight meetings. So, some one who logs in at 6:00 AM is supposed to log off at 3:00 PM. However, there is team meeting every fortnight on Wednesday at 6:30 PM which lasts for an hour and half , some times even more. So, a person who logs in at 6 AM will start at 5 AM and will log off at 9 PM and will reach home at 10:30 - 11 PM and again next day need to login on time. I want to ask the intelligent IIM managers how reasonable is this? This means 1. You don't respect your employees. 2. Once an Amazonian forget about your personal life. 3. No extra payments. 3. An Amazonian doesn't require any rest if he/she forgets his/her personal life. But yes, managers do log off on time. Old and favorite employees can login and log off as per their wish.	0.14509720976376686	0.2114397577152354	0.21979123363629735	0.23217195689576844	0.1914998419889319

Ruthless managers and unfriendly coworkers Amazon is a customer centric company. Whatever you do in Amazon, you should think of your customer. Nobody will help you with anything.

You may not even find a colleague to go to lunch with. Even worst, if you are good engineer, everybody will be looking to see you fail or creating an image of failure for you.

Worst Corporate Culture in America Huge growth, big Company, lots of momentum, lots of opportunity, unique culture, lots of smart people, good compensation Culture, big Company fast paced, no systems, lots of smart people (Chiefs but few Indians -essentially you are the Indian in any role you have). Absolutely no work life balance, in fact assume that you will work 60-70 hours a week on average and be expected to answer emails/phone calls at anytime. Day, night, weekends, holidays and even your vacation.	0.1791549075802107	0.1408942297116818	0.3209412341486632	0.23522398388418092	0.12378564467526323

Sink or swim. Are you built for this? Fast pace company where it is possible to get promoted quickly. Great stock and pay incentives for those coming out of school. If you get a good manager and you are identified as a top performer you will be pulled up. It is a fun fast pace environment. You literally have the power to make any changes that you see would be beneficial to the company if you are willing to do the work. When you are not in peak season it is common to have 3 day weekends. Nobody is going to BS you so you normally know where you stand. Work life balance during holiday season is non existent. It is not uncommon to work around 80 hours a week during the holiday season.. Sometimes you could be stuck with a terrible schedule and there's not always an option to switch. You must own your own development as no one is going to walk you through how to get promoted. Training is not always great when you are first hired and sometimes people are thrown to the wolves as it is a sink or swim environment. i have seen managers quit on their second day on the floor. Work life balance is not always great if you have kids or a life.	0.13348250168539239	0.21556673789924438	0.19455188412690447	0.23476090432751867	0.22163797196094007
It's all about the leadership principles. The leadership principles are not just words that we talk about in training and onboarding, we use them every day in meetings, decisions, and our work. It's refreshing to be someplace where they actually mean what truly live by those principles. It's fast paced and, despite the size, is extremely scrappy. There are not a lot of formalized processes--if you need something done, you do it. Also, a bad manager can ruin your experience, whereas a good manager makes all the difference.	0.1985576979591789	0.19864583974537084	0.20488844967635958	0.21816875304604705	0.17973925957304368
Warehouse associate, full time for over two years Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you. The 4 day weeks go by quick, it can be exhausting so proper rest and a healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company. Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee. After 3 years of working with the company you "cap out" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate. Your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage, by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings.	0.18922149711354722	0.19233642012773958	0.21212428097026131	0.272285907999689	0.13403189378876282

Family Room Specialist It has a good work-life balance, great discounts on the Apple products as well as on third party accessories and also discounts on mobile bills! Holiday discounts are pretty generous.  Apple trusts it's employee to make the right decision so we are given a lot of lee way when it comes to making judgement calls on technical issues.  Communications between management and worker is pretty open. If you have any concerns just ask for a quick meeting and they will set aside some time to talk. Sometimes the store gets so busy that we don't have the time to set aside for additional training.

Amazon Rocks! Great on-boarding! Amazon insists that all new staff "learn to walk before they [are allowed to] run." Lot's of training in the unique Amazon ways.  Support from management -- locally and globally -- is terrific. They are as invested in your success as you are, which is really refreshing. The unique recruitment process can be very long (4-12 weeks, or longer). A "necessary evil" to screen and recruit the best and brightness but potentially agonising for some candidates.	0.24050095755231696	0.23205894863189566	0.18654436510597922	0.2244487437895821	0.11644698492022611

A sometimes intellectually challenging but always toxic work environment *Some* smart people to work with, but you have to look long and hard to find them. Challenging problems to work on, but finding them is getting harder and harder. Relative autonomy if you do good work (but don't dream of working from home regularly). Good pay and reasonable benefits, *if* you've been there long enough. Incompetent leadership (even post Ballmer), with many leaders promoted from an internal "old boys network." Hard for everyone else to advance beyond a certain level. Zero leadership accountability (but great skill at buck-passing). No coherent or executable vision (eg, compare Microsoft's grand aspirations for the future of its mobile business with the reality of the marketplace). Size makes it hard for good new ideas to break through bureaucracy, processes and divisional "not invented here" syndromes. Widespread discrimination against female employees in mid level positions (and a bulletproof glass ceiling except for a few token appointments). One of the worst healthcare plans in the tech industry (used to be by far the best), and relatively poor work/life balance. HR department, once one of Microsoft's secret weapons, now very weak. Cares little about retaining the best and brightest (many of whom have left the company).	0.20132208551079128	0.16061520228663043	0.21831941521189457	0.2221426294432022	0.1976006675474814

Good place to work Excellent pay and benefits (by far the best software engineering pay I've seen in the Boston area). Higher bonus and stock than anywhere else, too. Extremely competent coworkers. Some interesting projects if you look for them. Work/life balance (read as 40 hrs workweek) is doable but you may feel a bit guilty about it as many self-impose longer hours or at least check email at crazy hours. Can be hard to feel like you're making an impact or get recognition in such a large company, especially a remote office. Most of the really interesting projects are in the Mountain View office. Kendall location is convenient to the T but not so great if you're looking to settle down outside of the city.	0.13009079434727674	0.2157270349622736	0.2284518692083344	0.23203399142374342	0.19369631005837182

Worth it if you have a good manager Great salary, okay benefits, great working culture, full of nice people. Plenty of opportunities to move around. Once you're inside Amazon, it's not that hard to reach out to internal hiring managers and have a chat. They take the Leadership Principles very seriously. The company has a clear vision. Follow these principles and you'll be fine. In 50%+ of the departments that I have been, there is no b.s. politics. Compensation is a tricky topic at Amazon. The stocks only start to kick in at your 2nd anniversary. Also, if the stocks are up, they give you little to no raise in annual reviews, unless you perform extraordinarily well. I kind of understand that the total compensation matters, but Facebook and Google gives you a raise regardless of the stock price.  While Amazon values meritocracy (a lot), some people are way overdue for promotion. If you have a bad manager, you'll be in big trouble. There is no system to ensure the managers don't abuse their employees. There is a daily survey called "Connections", but I have not seen any actions taken from the feedback. Do your due diligence before joining a team. Some teams exist essentially to make their business partners happy. In a past experience that I had, I supported an AWS team on the finance side. In that particular role, I was measured on how happy I made my business partners, not necessarily how much controllership I offered.	0.2043091843702252	0.2089211298413364	0.19735541358392444	0.30062279202194614	0.08879148018256795

Great perks, good compensation, but if you don't fit the company narrative you'll be marginalized fairly quickly. Campus is amazing, offices have all the perks you could ask for. Resources are never a problem. Despite what they say at the onboarding, or the all hands, or the company wide emails, upper management is not interested in hearing opposing views. Once you're branded as not being supportive of the collective group thought, your career path will be stunted. Tenure and support for the upper management team is weighted more heavily than individual skills. Your performance review will be mostly based on what others think of you rather than any projects you delivered. If your political skills aren't sharp you'll be collateral damage within your first year.	0.13541985569438092	0.25683076079968803	0.1745713619946328	0.1956095677715868	0.2375684537397114

Stower You get many hours & decent pay. Also you get a paid orientation which was nice and only a few hours. Back-breaking work. Everything was okay until the second day when they had us actually pushing the carts with bulk items and having to bust open the boxes and pull every bulk item out and scan it. Management was horrible I could never find anyone to ask for help, I would have to walk halfway across the entire store and then go searching for my cart again. The manager was supposed to tell us when we got our break but forgot to tell me and a few other people in my group so we didn't get one on my second day (keep in mind this is after 5 hours of slave labor) (a total of a ten hour shift) after that I clocked out and went home I could not handle it they were working me like a dog at that point.

A great company to work for 1. Very positive working environment for engineers, coworkers help each other out. 2. Be able to work on cutting edge technologies in Amazon. 3. Amazon got a great leader, Jeff Bazos, who is very smart and has made many right decisions. 4. Amazon dominates the e-retail business. 5. Amazon Web Services (AWS) are doing really well in the cloud computing market. 1. Operational tasks take a lot of time, as a result fewer time can be spent on actual development. 2. Oncall overheads in some teams are crazy and oncall can be paged many times. 3. Employee benefit is not that good.	0.18804221226833362	0.21385957226548943	0.1786963624450388	0.21081459121540805	0.2085872618057301
Easy to get hired This job was easy to get. No interviews. Just a drug test and background check. The work was repetitive for a while, but they will train you to do different tasks eventually. Standing for 10 hours a day, working 60 hours a week during peak season, and they hire anybody so no surprise I encountered a lot of creeps here.

Subsidiary and Corporate Product Marketing Experience across multiple products and businesses Lots of smart, passionate people. Great reputation and history. Great opportunities for future (Windows 8, Windows Phone, Xbox). Can find great spots to flex your strengths. Solid set of resources to tackle big problems.  Culture is more about what you get done than 'just looking good' (although the politics unfortunately corrode this 'pro') Too much of an emphasis on efficiency and not enough on efficacy. Senior leadership struggling to value vision along side cold hard numbers. Still see marketing as a cost and not an investment.  Career goal “having an individual impact”, Operating models, work flow, stale and ineffective process, duplication of roles, crossover of responsibilities resulting in duplication of effort and lack of accountability coupled with nonexistent budgets reduce ability for subsidiary Product Marketing to have an individual impact.  Many teams have a 'yes' culture and a pervasive inability of teams to work well together (I have experienced this far and wide).  Where there are people there are politics, however it is often chronic at Microsoft where those who crush others and take credit for others work (even their subordinates) are the ones who climb the ladder. We are then left with a leadership of ladder climbers rather than true leaders. People will follow true leaders and unfortunately there are not enough true leaders at Microsoft.  Deeply flawed review model that only allows the best to 'escape' to other teams.  Fix the review model which is a joke. Fix how we measure 'how' which as it stands only reinforces politics and popularity contests. Fix how managers vs. non-managers in the 63-64 band are measured. These should be crystal clear and documented types of impact and expectations. Change how the curve is enforced enabling teams to trade between levels and compensation buckets so that the appropriate message can be sent to employees vs. forcing the current curve on all organization as if they were all the same, which they are not e.g. senior vs. junior orgs, orgs with lots of high performers vs. those with average performers etc. We employee *how many HR* professionals they have to be able to figure this stuff out.  Career goal “increased impact through management and leadership”, Lack of mobility for ICs due to combination of flat org and lack of new blood/talent. In sub there doesn’t appear to be career progression outside of management. Often those chose to be managers do not appear to be in that role due to passion for managing and growing teams, or in the increasing their scope of impact, rather they appear to be there as it’s the only ‘way up’.	0.21591145144989016	0.19732153089188498	0.2291787705027832	0.2479426112139452	0.1096456359414965

Interesting experience I definitely enjoyed working with all the smart and motivated people in the company. They also treat their employees very well and I always felt needed, which I think it is a very strong motivator aside from the perks. They are also very flexible with time off and working from home, which also I respect, because they understand that their employees have their own lives to lead and work dosent always come first. Sometimes, people seem a bit pretentious. Working with some of these people with large egos could be challenging and dosent make for the best work environment. However, most of the time, the management is very in tune and sought to avoid problems with employees.	0.2007068478332163	0.2556796905339681	0.1698768042349445	0.24543680409100818	0.128299853306863

Terrible Management I got in early so I made money with the stock options. And I needed a job at that time and they gave me one. I also got to build the core software that keeps track of how many things are available for sale at a given moment. I learned a lot from an older co worker about the fungibilty of inventory, the theory of item is promised to a customer at a point of time, etc. How to build a system that is resilient to outages, bad data, data that is stale etc.  I also liked most of the engineers I worked with.  If you work here, you will be given tasks that at other companies would go to older and more experienced workers. The reason is that at the pay rate, those folks have left. or wouldn't join as they have other options. After a few years it became apparent that they didn't want trained managers, but instead just "yes people." No amount of suggestions that they run the new managers through training seemed to be heard.  Pager duty, you will come to hate it. If you have no life, you might not notice, but if you have a family they will hate it. It's what house arrest is all about. Oh sure you can go out, but you need to start working on a page within 20 minutes and not leave it until it's resolved. Try explaining that to your kids why you just packed them up from the park. Or your SO, why you need to get a box to go for dinner.  Pay rates, They have a 2 and a 4 year plan. That's because that's the length of time you need to wait for that first vesting of stock and signing bonus and the majority of that first grant.  Stack ranking, or rat on your co-workers to try and keep your job during review time. They cut the bottom 5% no matter how good they are in comparison to the rest of the world. They give PIP's to the bottom 10% (Ie threaten them), no raises to the bottom 20%. So if you have a group of 100, even though the company spent thousands on hiring them, waiting until they actually figured out how to do anything useful, training on the internal systems, they toss them right back out. What a waste of money. (It also demoralizes the team for a month or so every review cycle.)  If you want a better written review of the place, go find that NYTimes article, it was spot on.	0.2029657238099456	0.22976743047423814	0.22235723436742874	0.20725441075654746	0.1376552005918401

The Retail Side It's great here, when you have a dedicated team and management. I've learned that MSFT is very thorough in qualifications and has a lot of red tape-- but for good reason.  1. You're as worthy of moving up as you are dedicated. 2. You aren't going to be spoon fed opportunities to grow-- seek and you shall find. 3. Room to network and make your name out there. 4. The company actually listens to what Retail is saying and they grow with their employees. 5. They have, honestly, the /best/ coaching and constructive criticism training. I used to be an ASM at another retail company and I was honestly moved by how graceful managers are when it comes to attending to a problem and setting you up for success. 6. The pay is substantially more than other companies-- but be forewarned, with greater pay it comes with greater responsibility. 1. Everyone is working hard to better themselves, which means whether you work as a team or not, your impact is heavily weighed. You are constantly being evaluated and expected to grow as an employee-- and sometimes when you're hired from the outside and not thoroughly trained like in-sourced hires, you can feel like you're at a disadvantage or expected to know things that you haven't been trained for. This is not a job for those who are entry-level to the retail industry or the workforce in general. 2. Work/Life balance constraints: MSFT goes out of its way to make sure everyone is being worked at the minimum standard of 20 hours p. week (part-timers) which means that if you're going to school full time, working another job, or just have personal obligations, you need to be prepared to: A) Get two days off a week that will not be consecutive and B) Know your personal life 3 weeks in advance so you can request time off. For school this is especially difficult, because there are always opportunities outside of the classroom for E.C or even graded requirements. They can only be so lenient, and this is always going to be determined by 1) how good you are as an employee and 2) everyone else's availability.	0.12179319131633444	0.20074348427301578	0.1999747202147618	0.22047255407966937	0.25701605011621875

Good stable job with good benefits Lots of positions available in a very wide variety of tech areas. Most people are very intelligent and motivated to help and work with you.

The Place Where Smart People Go to Feel Bad About Themselves Young energy, customer obsession (in theory), compensation, some really talented, smart, and creative coworkers among the entry level corporate ranks. Dogs everywhere, especially golden retrievers and corgis. There are some good managers, good groups, creative thinkers who care about quality. Pretty LGBTQ-friendly, more trans-friendly than some. Mid-level managers (L6) with no demonstrated competence are propped up and promoted up, often take credit for their direct reports' wins. No work-life balance, expected to work on vacation, postpone health care based on company schedule, underhanded management practices of competent, high-performing employees managed out or blocking an internal transfer, ostensibly for performance issues, but usually for political or personal issues. Bullies thrive and are rewarded, promotions are given to people taking credit for lower level employees' work. HR is never on your side and can provoke retaliation if activated and your manager gets wind of it. Subtle overt/covert racist and misogynistic undercurrents. VP board reporting to CEO is 11 white males and 1 white female.	0.1727110733056598	0.17555420532423185	0.2912785958527997	0.24852774200604064	0.11192838351126805
Hard work pays off! Great benefits, 401k, Medical, online discount. lots of personal time and vacation but goes quickly. There are some incentives, like win a free TV or IPAD. I like working there, but during the holidays I never saw my family, so it was not worth it for me. Lack of communication kinda confusing at times. And you are on production if you don't meet your quota you do get written up then fired after so many times.. Also this a warehouse with lots of people so tons of drama.

Great Place to Start Your Career Microsoft's culture is changing and interesting! There is a company-wide effort in modernizing how work is done for software engineers and PMs. Yes, benefits are awesome, especially for a new grad. Smart people all around who are interesting and great people to work with. There are so many resources at your disposal. It's up to you to take advantage of them all. At least for the team I work with, the average age of my team is in the lower to mid 30s, which is jarring for me. For me, things also sometimes moves at a slower pace than I like. Obviously, this can be both a good and a bad thing, but I'm in the camp of moving fast.	0.18273588762796694	0.20782471283578177	0.1968395449780354	0.21918601089133083	0.19341384366688494

Meat Grinder It's a huge company with a lot of job openings. It's easier to get hired in at a high level than it is to work your way up. The requirements and standards for an employee are very high and sometimes objective. Ergo if you want to work towards something and your boss doesn't like you for any reason they can block you from promotions and make you tread water for years.

Impressive, innovative company. Opportunity to work with smart, innovative people. Enthusiasm for the company from long term employees is high. People stay for many years and are rewarded for their loyalty. Very difficult to make an impact as a new employee in a satellite office. Most of the decisions are made in Redmond, so there is little opportunity for growth and innovation. Employees are not sufficiently empowered. This is due in part to the staying power of the long term employees. It leaves little opportunity for professional growth.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Could use more people who want to push boundaries and challenge the existing mindset -A lot of people who don't contribute much but have been at the company so long they're allowed to stay -Reorgs are common, but you get used to it	0.20523290205252037	0.21426794464355878	0.163916787687522	0.20568407073176356	0.2108982948846353
Cons outweigh pros for a healthy job satisfaction. 1) The company is full of really smart and talented people. 2) Some orgs within MS are better to deal with than others. 3) Satya Nadella seems fantastic and pioneering as the CEO. 4) Benefits are great. 1) There are a lot of bad managers (especially any orgs related to Windows/Bing Apps) and peer politics at workplace (most orgs). 2) Unreasonable layoffs and frequent reorgs in core engineering jobs. One org infamously laid off all new hires with < 1 year of MS experience. RIF's not based on performance is a moral dampener. 3) Review system is really bad. You should be reviewed for the primary job that you are hired to do, which includes quality, timely delivery, team building, good work ethics. But here, you need to show what they call as "impact", which is doing any unrelated project or talk or brown-bag, that makes you visible to the higher-ups. If you are not capable of doing this one thing, then no matter how qualified you are at your job, skills and experience, you will stay at the same level for years! Even though the "ratings" are removed, it's the same old stack-ranking review system with a fancy new name.	0.21901078740474125	0.19252237329305893	0.1762957095230576	0.2628680647763615	0.14930306500278076

Former Manager Very good job satisfaction, high performing stocks, challenging work. The review is entirely about IT.  Very political environment. Lots of back stabbing/finger pointing. Fearful/threatening environment, incompetent middle management who drive away good talent for political sake, no room to make mistakes which kills creativity. Upper management / HR is very arrogant as the company is doing extremely well. Not so great compensation/poor benefits compared to many other big companies in the Silicon valley. Upper management is always trying to please the executives and in turn forget to respect employees. Poor people management skills in the middle management.

Great company but (now-former) stack rank mentality hurts company Reputation, world-class employees and facilities, and benefits. I pinch myself every day. Iceberg minutiae of things...the number of approvals required up the change of command is frustrating - not agile. Don't make everybody and anyone a PM, some need to learn the ropes first and then become a PM. I understand there are superstars, but there are some who either can't PM or were put in that position and won't let go of what they used to do.  I am torn because working is a dream come true and, compared to other tech companies, it really is a spectacular place. But, I don't feel like I do as much work as I can - between the number of approvals needed and all the meetings, I feel stuck - I feel like we should be moving much faster.	0.20630063161160267	0.1542877716723432	0.2078888790762962	0.24477436612057388	0.186748351519184

Honest Review - Good buzz atmosphere as if something exciting is happen each day. It makes you feel you are doing something important. - Working with like-minded IT technical employees, who are also passionate about learning, if you want to learn, sell, support, market, consultant, enterprise technology its a great software corporation to work, and learn a job in a big company. - If you have huge drive and passion, its a phenomenal company to deliver. - Career opportunities are limited outside the US, especially as so many in higher positions are staying in their current positions for 5, 10, 20 years or more, it will be very difficult to get a good position i.e. progress through the ranks, work your way up, than if you had joined in the 1990's, and very early 2000's. Today, the company is over 120,000 employees, so there is very little room for career progression " and say I can be here 20, 30 years. - Work is constant changing, always being challenged too much. The job description is very different reality to when you get inside and on board. You will have to take tasks which are always above your normal job title. - Review system is "we have two slices of cake" to share with 10 people in a department, a lot of people feel its very unfair, as everyone is chipping in and adding to Microsoft's value. One year you can get a slice of cake, next year none, yet you did same work as year before.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Run! You get to work at home and set your own hours. Also you do get health benefits after 90 days. And there is an employee discount of 10%. Not very much though. You get to keep your job if all the customer surveys are good. This is an impossible task. There is no way a customer service rep is able to make every customer happy. Also the lead monitors are horrible! Stephanie was mine and she was critical about every little thing! She would criticize me all day long in a mean and angry tone. It made working at Amazon a miserable experience. I do not recommend anyone to work there. Everyone goes in with a positive attitude that they are strong and can take the criticism and improve themselves but eventually they wear you down where you don't even want to be there anymore. I saw my whole team get picked off one by one. If it happened to them it will happen to you too. Run! Find a company that wants to keep and retain people not get rid of them.

Lots of challenge, lots of opportunity, lots of work In my experience, Amazon's leadership principles guide the company. There's emphasis on working backwards from the customer to deliver value, on innovation, and on technical excellence. There's willingness to take risk, and willingness to learn from poor outcomes, rather than look for someone to blame. Amazon's out dated personnel system means competition, rather than collaboration, among those who understand there must be a low performer, and low performers are moved out of the business. Excessive demand on development teams, coupled with poor support structures, mean dev's and dev managers are constantly pushed to do more with less, then held accountable for not having time to go deep, deliver value, etc.	0.1678466889937053	0.22911820280628525	0.22394495737178163	0.2039810850436771	0.17510906578455077

Take time to look for team and project that suit you Good compensation and benefits. Company has lots of resources allocated to R&D. Great place to start one's career out of college. Tons of interesting projects that can be found with some effort. Heavy-weight processes / middle-management. Lack of agility, wasteful in terms of engineering resources. Some organizational culture that encourages staff to be passive-aggressive. Some decisions are made by politics instead of data-driven. Career growth may be limited depending on team / project. Work-life balance takes back seat in organizations that build and support online services.	0.19261503684195055	0.200411640157613	0.19118815981850765	0.24923203932044705	0.16655312386148155

Customers first, Employees fifth If you work as a picker or stower, this job can give you a great workout. The people are mostly very friendly and approachable and it is customary to engage in a little chit-chat in order to maintain sanity. Full-time permanent employees get lots of chances to take time off including paid time and the dress code is very liberal. While some days can be worse than others, the work is generally extremely monotonous. Burnout is inevitable. The atmosphere on the floor and get lonely and at times depressing as it seems that no one really wants to be here.

Severely long hours = McDonald's hourly wage - Apple name on resume - Employee discount... isn't worth the trouble, pain, and PTSD you will experience - At least 60-80 work weeks. Expect to work late nights, weekends, and holidays. While the company shuts down for Thanksgiving, you can expect to be working in Finance. Say goodbye to family dinners, time with friends, and any semblance of a life. - Low merit increases that don't even cover inflation and cost of living. - No annual bonus because management wants to keep it for themselves. No stock re-ups because you're a support function. - Management will take your work as their own and cut you out of meetings with leadership. You will not be recognized for any work you do so don't expect career mobility. - Too many big egos at play. Environment hostile and full of finger pointing. HR completely useless when issues are brought to their attention. You will meet more jerkholes here than anywhere else you may have worked in the past or future. - Expect to work during vacations. Everyone's job is so pigeon holed in their job that there's no one to adequately back you up. Work will just keep piling up and you will be even farther behind if you do not log in. - Management will not hesitate to contact you on your personal cell phone during all hours of the day. They don't care what you're doing, only that they need something from you. - Despite producing great products, the company does a pathetic job investing in systems to help employees manage the massive amount of work and pace. The processes are outdated, not scaled to handle the work volume, and employee inputs are not taken in consideration. Those employee surveys are a complete joke. - The turnover is atrocious. Expect close to 100% turnover on an annual basis. There was an employee on my team who turned in her resignation after a month. It's no wonder there are so many open reqs on the company website all the time.	0.2241149489897165	0.1275823721106978	0.20112270863988818	0.23840318360168228	0.20877678665801527

Good company, your experience will vary greatly depending on the group you are in Causal work environment, lots of talented, smart, passionate people, opportunity to make an impact in the world through your work, and good health benefit (although that is changing 2013). In some groups, leadership (directors and above) are so focused on the politics and self advancement that things are not always done for the good of the company. On some teams, the "perception" of what you do matters way more than the actual accomplishment you achieved. The performance review system and its forced distribution model are partly to blame, but I think there are just a lot of poor managers, especially at the Director and Senior Director level - lots of Microsoft lifers who don't have outside experiences and perspectives.	0.2065034293120898	0.1680102272480267	0.2282813449257409	0.2357182552269091	0.16148674328723353

Good place to work right out of school You learn a lot in a short time period here, and working 2 years here is pretty much the equivalent in technical and business skills as a masters degree. There are many options to move to once you're in the company, and their ideals for leadership are good ideals. I appreciate the fact that they follow the idea that no matter your level or experience, your opinion will still be heard. It is not often you get rank pulled on you (but it still happens occasionally). Expectations of how much you should work seem to be skewed by management. Not a very clear promotional cycle between SDE-1 and SDE-2. It seems very difficult to move up in the company once you hit SDE-3.	0.22031351188738776	0.1799227013746996	0.185818912349891	0.24566460256392267	0.168280271824099

This was once the greatest company for customers and the most fun and challenging for work Prestige… if you land in an interesting department you might be on something cutting edge. Amazon is now just another corporation. The frontiership of c 2000 is long over but some of the long hours are not. Annual attrition in some departments, like warehouses (DCs), approaches 100%.

OK TO WORK HERE TO MEET YOUR TEMPORARY NEEDS. The hiring process is quick and simple. They hire lots of people to fill their many open positions. They do not your previous work experience.

Great local culture, but probably best for current undergrads Atmosphere in general is great. The staff there is highly diverse, allowing you to constantly interact with literally hundreds of incredibly interesting people. Store management legitimately seemed to care about the employees, going so far as to put their own careers on the line to defend their own. There is a strong emphasis on generating excitement for the Apple brand and culture that can at times be borderline "drinking the koolaid". While local management was great, interactions with corporate management showed a side of Apple that was markedly not... Apple-like, particularly when it came to throwing employees under the bus and focusing entirely on spreadsheet numbers rather than customer experience.  Considering that you could be selling well over $1 million in revenue every quarter, the wages were pretty subpar, especially since there is no commission. Annual reviews with fractional salary increases provided little opportunity for your performance to be appropriately recognized and rewarded.	0.1919421665427347	0.2512980366558478	0.15713618289698425	0.23111546281699943	0.16850815108743386

Operations Manager, Northeast Region FC Amazon will challenge every skill you thought you were good at and discover some new ones that you didn't know you had. You will be challenged hourly to work with team-mates that want to work with you or work against you. Operations is a true test of patience, time-management and fortitude, even those that find this challenge too much, will admit the lessons they learned.  Overall, Amazon offers incredible "at the door" incentives. I am sure you can read them in other reviews, but the life and professional experience is worth the blood, sweat and tears you will shed within an Amazon FC. Fulfillment is not for everyone, warehouse work is not for everyone and Amazon is not for everyone. Amazon Operations is very fast paced and unforgiving when it comes with meeting our promise to our customers to get their shipments out on time, every time. It is test the mettle of many people and many people will go on to do other things. Work-life balance is an on-going challenge, but is indeed part of operations. It is unfortunate, but this is the nature of fulfillment, regardless of the name on the building. Orders must go out and those orders do not stop.	0.16590547435845854	0.21067420840068168	0.18429813705621534	0.2498526745659173	0.18926950561872707

Too much overhead for established products/services and not enough on new ones. Satya is pushing new cultural expectations though there is some disconnect from him down to the folks doing the work.

You can easily switch teams within Microsoft if you get bored with current work or team. You can work in different technologies. 1. Some MS products are in maintenance mode and if you are stuck in those teams there is not much to learn. 2. Management has lot of old guys with 20+ experience who are not adding much value to the company but are holding top posts. 3. Some products do not have clear future road map and they get shut down before reaching the customers.	0.22467107347064721	0.09901080654426125	0.1848201722159543	0.2663228693407168	0.2251750784284204

Best company I have worked for yet At Amazon, you own your own destiny. You are given the framework within which to work, the Amazon Leadership Principals, and given autonomy to get results, in your own style. Leaders lead and they don't manage. We are challenged to think big, innovate and we are allowed to fail. Now working for Amazon, I am approached daily with job opportunities, from some of the best companies on the plant, but I am not interested in leaving Amazon any time soon. Some of my friends view Amazon, Facebook, Google et al as not good for the planet and small businesses, the little guys. Personally I think Amazon is just change, a new way of doing business.	0.1770331979714837	0.22552191796266488	0.22482373879170725	0.22882724683025815	0.1437938984438861

Very bad, no real upward mobility, purposely have very high turnover rate, backbreaking work Pay per hour is relatively high in comparison to other readily available jobs in local areas. If you are full-time and permanent, your total hours a week is average around 38+ hours a week Your health insurance bi-weekly premium is cheap. You can take your personal time off without much hassle because it is consider pretty much considered pre-approved. After you been there over one year, you can quickly accumulate vacation time on monthly basis. You have begin working through temp agency which means you can be fired anytime for bogus reasons. They purposely have high turnover rate among both temp and full-time workers to keep wages low. When checking for transfer opportunities, you are stuck in area where you work currently, in other words, if you work in warehouse, then you can not really transfer to computer tech or office clerk because they made requirements very difficult to meet. They stated clearly that they are not willing to train employees if they transfer to completely different jobs. Top managers including its CEO had stated publicly that employees are not important because there are many people looking for jobs so employees are easily replaceable. They disregard employees' long term consequence of severely straining physical body of employees by requiring to meet outrageous very high numbers for processing products/items per minute. They are not getting any inputs from medical doctors when they determine various work requirements.	0.2079477661040702	0.23540735348659309	0.2278152650399399	0.18766499578316995	0.141164619586227
Lead Genius Of all of the things that are worth while to work at the Apple store, it is the look on people's faces when you show them something extraordinary - something they didn't even know before - and they get this look on their face. "Wow," is the refrain. Also the benefits, and coworkers are amazing. The schedule is erratic. Like, wildly. It's retail and they justify the crazy schedule because you needed to have completely open availability to get the job. Being a Lead Genius means you have to not complain about it either. Working in consumer tech support is also pretty grinding. Lead Geniuses get involved with customer when they are already upset. Getting actually screamed at was a regular occurrence. Security occasionally gets involved.  If you get to be a Lead Genius, but don't want to be in Retail Management? You've hit your ceiling.	0.15921495669466734	0.2680932358060239	0.1114373978507421	0.21297668024347235	0.24827772940509435

Great Company, but middle management is meh... While the benefits are nowhere near what they used to be, they are still very good in the Puget Sound region. Additionally, the resources for collaboration (spin up a sharepoint, no problem!) are exceptional. When harnessed, the power of the talent there working together can do spectacular things. The silos in the company are amazingly stupid. The company has pockets where general managers can dictate how littler or much the company will work together. The One Microsoft initiative has a LONG way to go. Also the quality of managers at the director level still varies widely. Some sr. directors are in their position because they can operate politically, and not because they're the right fit for the role or company. Longevity sometimes outweighs being good at your job. The rating system (calibration) forces management to value individual contribution over group success, reinforcing the silos and perpetuating the inability to harness the power of the company overall. One bad rating, and you're done. While encouraged to learn from failures, too many times I have seen good employees put on the outside quickly for loyalty to a project or initiative that the wrong person didn't like. There's no room for improvement, therefore no one wants to admit failure.	0.2286972017669218	0.19134665440411472	0.24274595853315467	0.19965318222050824	0.1375570030753006

Bad management, great co-workers Good opportunities to learn. Talented co-workers. There are opportunities to move to other teams which is helpful. The managers can do anything when it comes to reviews. Peer reviews doesn't matter, your rating is decided in this closed-door meeting with other senior managers that you might have never known of and they always try o bring the rating down if the product quality is not upto expectations. People who get good reviews or promoted are these ones who worship such managers. I have not seen this bad of a culture in any other company. The company says it has improved this process, but didn't. I think it went the other way. Poor benefits. 401k match is the lowest.

You're looked after very well in terms of benefits and comp. The Sydney office has become increasingly corporate and there's plenty of office politics. It's great place for someone who is early in their career, however unless you love media sales it's a challenge to find the right role for those who are more advanced in their career.	0.20310421662345923	0.199923346349661	0.21877991292370225	0.24361718770610838	0.1345753363970691

Best job ever I work from home in almost any attire I want, I have responsibilities but they are very reasonable and I'm not on a script when on a call. They pay me fantastically, my manager is a very easy going, easy to get along with kind of guy. There are also a lot of opportunities to move up or around.

Avoid IS&T like plague If you get a chance, work in the core groups that deal with iOS,OSX, iTunes, AppStore, etc. Avoid IS& T. IS&T = Information services and technology 1. I worked in IS&T group at apple. This IS&T is totally different from the main Apple. I have often heard this: "Those who don't make it into the infinite loop, end up at IS&T". In other words, IS&T is a second rate citizen at apple. Of course, IS&T supports many IT services (jobs, recruiting, payrolll, mail, directory, sales, GBI). For instance, online and retail stores are supported by IS&T.  2. You see 3 contractors for every employee in IS&T. And IS&T has global contracts with Infosys, TCS, Wipro, etc, the latter companies supply 1 online resource for every 4 offshore resources. In many application support groups, you find the dumbest of the dumb among the people that global offshoring companies have placed.  3. Too much politics and too many lifers in IS&T. The only game in the town for IS&T is to how to brown nose each other. Yes, there are too many Indians there, as a consequence, you find smart people among them, and dumbos as well.  4. Advice to prospective employees: if you are talented, and if you can find a better job, just avoid any and every group in IS&T. Someone may say "Oh, apple gonan help you on your resume", it is half true. If you are smart, talented, you don't to worry about the apple factor on resume.  If you get a job in the core engineering groups, go for it. If you are interviewing in IS&T, just avoid any offer and go and work elsewhere, and increae your skills.  5. If you are applying for some project manager, manager, teamleads (for app support, etc), of course, you won't have much choice. I don't complain if you go for IS&T: but it is a great place to learn politicking. This politicking has led to more offshoring, why? The more employees you get, the more you need to fight for bonus for your group, so, it is better to offshore, and keep less number of employees, and get more bonus.  6. You are not going to get any quarterly bonus, however, people in core groups get such bonuses. Some people don't get first year bonus in IS&T. And the bonus is like 7 to 10 percent. Don't come here, hoping that you gonna get similar wages in core engineering groups.	0.19930314214297407	0.19701974687458912	0.22032171324169186	0.22749931603403198	0.15585608170671283
SSP Nice building Depending on alignment, obtaining bonuses can be extremely easy You would think working for one of the largest software developers in the world would be a blessing. I expected an agile, feedback based, open work environment and like minded culture. Boy was I wrong.  Unfortunately Microsoft Dublin is influenced by an archaic management system. Micromanagement has clearly been invented in this office. Senior managers taking pictures of people's work space when they're not sitting behind their desk. Endless spreadsheets to fill in (who needs MSX right?). A dozen internal meetings a week, and therefor no time for actual customer contact.  'Initiatives' that create visibility amongst other teams are rewarded by management. Think of colourful spreadsheets, mail merges, mass importing MSX data, and so on.. Often these endeavours only take up valuable time, create more overhead and generally demotivate people.  As Management is only interested in short term wins (Quarterly at best), calling customers is not rewarded because that implies long term relations, planning, complex engagements, etc. Instead, maintaining an inflated bubble-like pipeline full of nonsense is what is required to survive here. This has to be presented (and kept up-to-date daily) in MSX, Excel and Powerpoint all at the same time. There is no actual verification of work done and I can promise you that our pipeline is 95% FAKE and has been since I joined.  Priorities seem to shift on a weekly basis, largely depending the quality of sleep our leadership had the night before. Or maybe its the direction of the wind, who knows.  Most capable people have left or are in the process of leaving. What remains is a cyclical self serving corrupt workforce that has no intention of doing their best for Microsoft.	0.2105844244721494	0.1349134849492773	0.13673089149249276	0.31138979707767545	0.20638140200840507
Smart people, great benefits, still terrible review system MS still attracts plenty of smart people and offers great benefits (even if the platinum health insurance has been downgraded). As the company matures, there's more work/life balance - in some groups. MS is also far more charitable than Amazon - matches employee donations and hours, allows for payroll deductions, and has a day when the entire company volunteers. The Darwinian review system favored by Gates has changed clothing several times but is still a stack-ranking system that puts everyone on a bell curve. Only a few can be rewarded, and someone must always be the sacrificial lamb. As a result, trust is low, cross-team work very challenging, and politics are rampant. It's not about what helps the customer, it's about what lets management tell the best story at review time.	0.09010552643719606	0.26797974643678646	0.24890777056038638	0.26021986497397376	0.13278709159165733

Great company, great benefits, great people. Nearly everyone I worked with was friendly and professional. I've had a few managers there and they were all fantastic. The department I was in was exceptionally run, although our product struggled to get off the ground. Late nights were few and far between and I felt that I had complete control over my schedule most of the time. As an SDET, not all the work was that interesting. We got stuck doing a lot of manual tests since vendors weren't budgeted for our department. Also, sometimes it felt like we were all waiting round for something to happen.

Times Are Changing Great people who believe in the vision, love to talk technology, passionate about changing the world. Executive leadership trying to create a "sales culture", using a Walmart model. A byproduct of this approach is a consistent culling of technology-focused individual contributors, in favor of bringing pure sales people in from other companies.  Employee Review system is broken, outdated, and assumes that every team has someone that should be fired. Microsoft is trying to become a "Devices & Services" company, recognizing that devices are very personal. Unfortunately, the devices are designed to push the Windows/Office platform, which is not necessarily what consumers and businesses want anymore. Sometimes "good enough" is good enough.  Management always talks about how much opportunity there is at Microsoft, but they neglect to mention that you must live in Redmond to get it (some exceptions, but for the most part, this is still true.)  Benefits used to be amazing, but with recent changes, employees are forced to become their own adjusters, negotiating directly with care-providers and cross-checking EOB forms for completion/accuracy.	0.14662197062333543	0.257819328304042	0.20685149031187522	0.22116745774670987	0.16753975301403753

Great talent but too political Work with many talented people. Receive competitive pay and benefits. In theory, there are many opportunities for growth and career advancement, and the company has the potential to do massively awesome things. Suffers from being so large and bureaucratic. The goal setting and leveling process can incentivize a lot of counter-productive work and internal conflict.

More than you would expect from a retail experience. Working in Apple Retail allowed me to have a flexible schedule so I could focus on my studies during college. I met a ton of people from all over the world, all walks of life, and really just was able to engage with individuals about their technology that I would otherwise not have the opportunity to meet. I learned quite a lot about Apple technology, computers and enterprise set ups in general, and was trained thoroughly on the technologies I was expected to support. I had fun co-workers and they helped to support one another in their customer encounters, as well as educate. Overall I had a positive learning experience there, and while some days the interactions were not top notch, or I had to deal with an irate client, I eventually learned a great deal of patience, empathy and humility from my peers. In any retail environment, you run the risk of being micro-managed by a supervisor who doesn't quite understand the scope of your daily activities, nor is attentive to employee needs. Sometimes the management fails to set clear or sustainable expectations. In my time at Apple Retail specifically, I found that we would be so engrossed in the tasks at hand that I wasn't getting adequate breaks, or some days, would end up having to miss lunch altogether on an 8-9 hour shift. Working a desk job, this would not always be an issue. But when you are on your feet for hours a day...	0.09569830289111989	0.21564023640407917	0.23918826004990312	0.25574222026796295	0.19373098038693487

Mixed Reviews... Many people complain about the work environment being too fast paced and quality oriented, but what did everyone expect? This company uses one of the most advanced and efficient distribution systems in the world. To be a part of such an intricate system requires knowledge and an ability to produce results that won't clog up the efficiency of the system. The work is hard, detail-oriented, and at times tedious but a job here is also tremendous fun if you can get lost in your work. It's also a genuine opportunity. Less nimble minds fail to see in the long term and look only at the short-term monotony. A job you respect at this company can easily turn into a career. There are many complainers in the workplace. "The work is too hard, the work is too boring, the management is horrible," there are tons more. I've found almost all of them to be false when it comes down to it. Every measure is taken to ensure environmental and ergonomic safety, and also to ensure production is as simple as possible.	0.14380173720326841	0.10737976848602265	0.26156069980361024	0.2595052324510569	0.22775256205604175

Still great perks, but getting big, bureaucratic, and slow The perks at Google are as awesome as advertised. The food is better than most restaurants, the office spaces and campuses are the envy of most college campuses, and the on-site massages are legendary. You will be working alongside extremely talented co-workers who will challenge you and force you to step up your game. Google is getting big and slow. As you rise through the company, you will find that more and more of your day is spend in endless meetings and wading through nonstop e-mail chains. There are far too many stakeholders involved in every decision, and there is often no clear owner for a particular project. The left hand often doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Shades of Microsoft from the late 90s - a company that is phenomenally profitable but undisciplined and becoming unwieldy. Many Google employees have essentially "checked out," and come in at 9:30 and leave at 5, and are never challenged.	0.19038962279439753	0.2002377626499384	0.2081467806668361	0.21987157808550958	0.18135425580331835

This company is not to be taken seriously The work/life schedule is pretty okay. You don't get paid enough for the stress that every single position will have you under.

The managers are all clueless about your role but will stress you out about your numbers even though they know the job gets held up by all the defective bar codes from all of the fake products they sell people from china.

Disruptive company... for all the wrong reasons! An opportunity to work with some of the smarter people around. Coworkers are generally very helpful and forthcoming. Your Work Life Balance will suffer. Supply Chain teams are one of the worst that I ve seen in my career.  Obselete systems (if any). A simple data pull takes forever because of the poorly designed systems. Teams create their own slice and dice of data and you will spend a majority of time in trying to match up numbers.  No concept of setting goals and milestones. Everyday will be different as in you will not have any sense of what you will assigned when you show up for work. Good luck when you are trying to write your feedback for year end performance. Performance reviews are based in feedback of Cole ages and coworkers. If you are not good at office politics, you will feel the pain when reviews come out. Stack ranking ours extra pressure on employees.  Management is extremely poor. Due to extremely high attrition rate, employees who stick around for 2-3 years are pushed up the management ladder. Lack of experience is/will hurt the company in the long run. No efforts to motivate employees.  Compensation is strictly ok. Annual pay raise is 2-3% and you are mostly rewarded in stocks.  Any experience outside amazon is not given any value. It's either the Amazon way or the highway.	0.2191264364167976	0.2227336480192037	0.24564882148985498	0.2187792627577023	0.09371183131644142

You will live the company motto,  For the industry there is great pay, strong benefits package, great co-workers, & visionary leadership.  I'm given the opportunity the opportunity to take on new responsibility and grow consistently over the years. I've had the chance to travel, domestically and abroad, a dozen times.  The company gets involved in the community, not as much as I would like to see, but they are good corporate citizens to our area.  Amazon is the truest meritocracy of which I've been a part. Strong performance is rewarded, while poor performance is managed out or to a a better fitting role. There is always some favoritism in every organization, but I've seen the least amount here.  My favorite thing about Amazon is how it really follows it's mission of being the 'Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company." Like the Bible or Constitution, being 'customer-centric' can be interpreted differently by different people, but in my experience, a positive impact of customers, and then employees, is at the forefront of every decision. (Con for some) High paced, constantly changing environment. Extremely competitive.  This is not a company where you can be good for a long time and stay where you are. You have to be GREAT, you have to innovate, and you have to challenge yourself, or you will be managed out.  Customers truly come first, but that means employees may come second. Amazon is content with adding more challenges and expectations on employees, if it improves the customer experience. This is fine for a while, but I've seen it wear down many great leaders until they fizzle out.  To be successful and drive change, it is impossible to work 40 hour work weeks. The management group especially has to be incredibly flexible with their schedules, and often work 50 or 60+ hour work weeks. Sr. Leadership speaks against this and says we have to have more work-life balance, but then they delegate more and more work down. I'm doing work that wasn't even performed by my manager's level 2 years ago. In addition to this extra workload, we shy away from hiring junior leaders, so there are fewer capable leaders to carry the operational workload. - This said, I'm a workaholic that appreciates the grind, but it burns others out.	0.09625276378235252	0.24953470228629482	0.2183186182577634	0.2361932921129489	0.19970062356064028

Experience is highly team/project dependant First off, you get to work on problems at huge scale. Even the simplest issues can become remarkably thorny and non-trivial at such scale. Second, Google has arguably one of the best developer tools in the industry. It helps you be many times more efficient than the average. Third, Google's hiring bar is very high, so your co-workers are often brilliant, and you are seldom slowed down by dependencies on other engineers/teams. Google is large, and so each Product Area / Product / Team have their own sub-culture. You might fit well in some, and be a miserable in others. There really is no good way to tell. Having brilliant co-workers is a double-edged sword. This also implies a lot of competition for interesting projects, and the bar for getting a promotion is so high that it is not uncommon for people to get promoted for over 5 years or more.	0.17536346258796343	0.18443435563229268	0.2345269723497174	0.23863401366550083	0.1670411957645257

Great Company Turned Mediocre There are few places where you get to work on projects that have the scale of Microsoft Windows, or Office. The benefits are great. If you're in the right group, it's a great place. The company manages the bulk of employees to feel as if they are just another cog in the wheel - nothing special. Save the company a billion dollars and you're told you're just doing your job. If you are over 40, you are likely to be managed out within 5 years. Trend is to replace American workers with H-1B Visa holders. The culture of the company has changed. It is no longer inspiring but it is a solid job.

Fulfillment Associate -- most fun I have had at a job Most of the days I spent working at the fulfillment center were either very fun or felt very rewarding at the end of the night. It was usually pretty motivating and management did make a consistent effort to make the environment fun(ny) and exciting. In a way, it was like getting paid to have a gym membership. Also, the physical conditions are excellent compared to other warehouses--very comfortable even though hot at times unless you stay hydrated. My location was very willing to train employees on other areas and most of the time I wasn't doing the same thing each week. I enjoyed coming into work most of the time. Trainers/feedback is meant to help you and isn't accusatory, there were also coaches in your similar position (stower/packer/counter/...) that would help you along the way. At the stand-up meetings, most of the time you were aware of how you were functioning as an individual and as part of your team, always fun competitions for gift cards and so on based on productivity. Career advancement / tuition reimbursement is possible even if not directly related to Amazon (for healthcare such as phlebotomy and others), this is excellent for college students paying bills along the way to further themselves through Amazon or elsewhere. I switched my shift pattern to adjust my schedule for schooling, but wasn't told anywhere that I had to remain on the accepted shift for more than 90 days before being able to transfer to other shifts. I wouldn't have done so if I knew this or signed something, but I would go back at any time. Productivity and quality rates at times can be unrealistic if there is an inconsistent work flow, but this depends on department and no one is held accountable or reprimanded if its understood that these factors are outside of our control. Mandatory overtime is somewhat common, but should be expected when you sign up! I never minded it but can be troublesome if someone is looking for a work/life balance--probably won't happen (at really any warehouse during holiday season).	0.17121380373430753	0.17403228802776693	0.19193699216706606	0.2940512540096428	0.16876566206121665

Difficult to transition for level 59 and under employees (entry level and support roles) Really great work-life balance, clear mission, making strides in tech involvement in many different areas. Good experience with managers and team, overall recognition of hard work. Great benefits. Starting at a low level in the company makes it difficult to move around unless you are in engineering. Still existing silos.

The fun is gone and the operation burden keeps coming. - If you are a college hire, you will learn a lot, from discussing business requirements, writing tech specs, coding and testing, to deploying features to productions. You will learn them all. - Project is very cool sometimes, but get buried so much under processes and guidelines. Just let me build the thing already. - What else? What else is there? I don't know. Probably nothing else. - Healthcare and Benefits: from what I hear from my friends working at other tech companies, Amazon pretty much has nothing. Just nothing. - Work Equipment: horrible. I am still using the Macbook from 2011 and not allowed to upgrade to newer machine until 2017. I would have to pay out of my pocket for memory upgrade and switch from normal hard drive to ssd. Of course, all in the name of "Frugality". I am just not sure how it can be frugal where I have to spend a lot of time waiting for things to run and process while on the clock. And once upon a time, we were so looking forward to acquire monitor from interns who are about to leave, because Amazon would refuse to give us two monitors of 22". Luckily, at least that's over. - Performance Review and Salary: I have had many reviews so far and it always seems subjective. Like April this year, I got exceed for engineer rating and solid for leader principle, and I got <2% pay raise. Total compensation, stock included, goes down from last year. In another word, I get a pay cut for a good performance review. Who does that? Talked to manager and HR, nothing they can do about it. And thanks to Glassdoor, I know that I am underpaid even comparing to other engineers at the same level at the SAME company. - Retention rate is very low. My department is considered one of the good one in term of work life balance and everybody is nice and such, But people keep leaving. Business keeps asking for projects to be built while we don't have enough resources and don't even care about operational support. They just want things to be done for their own promotion, then get promoted, and leave the burden behind. Engineers are quoted on their words about "rough/initial" estimation and got pressured onto that "promises" to get things done. Inexperienced engineers make that amateur mistakes all the times and burn themselves out. Engineers like me stay in the department because of promises about promotion, different and interesting project, but of course pay raise is kinda out of question but only for a very few people. (Perhaps I am not that good of an engineer. If so, why even bother rating me exceed in engineer performance many years in a row?) - Technical challenge: not much. Once you passed the first 1 or 2 years of learning as new hires, it pretty much dies down from there. - Pager (it especially sucks if your team has less than 5 people. That means you would be oncall once a month or more) - Mentor: hit and miss. I am fortunate to have some very great mentors. But my friends seem to have a complete opposite of spectrum. He has to learn everything, plays nice with his mentor although that mentor is not even helpful. - Managers and some engineers tend to present the Amazon's problem in a very engineer way: it is not perfect and very challenging but there will always be room for improvement and you can contribute to that. Sure, it's possible, if only you work their days and nights, weekend included to get your work done and achieve those goals.  You probably ask why I am still working there after so many complaints I made above. Well, I love my teammates. They are some of the best engineers I have had a chance to work with. They are all moving on now. I am the last man standing. Prepping for the interviews now. If you are working for Amazon, move on, NOW. If you plan to work for Amazon, at least ask for the ton of money or a very special project. Last word, just get out.	0.18714109507383017	0.1776470601140959	0.23673008856726022	0.25230042126014673	0.1461813349846669

A mixed review! - A leading tech player in the world committed to making the world more open and connected. Everything Facebook does will impact people in a massive way. Very credible & humbling to be a part of such a journey  - You're taken care of. You really don't worry about day to day things which otherwise eat up your time. The benefits & perks have got you covered  - Bright, Young & Passionate people to work with. You don't want to be a part of a group which has had a conventional approach to things. Peeps at facebook come from different parts of the country, unique experiences & have a zest to perform. - The Hyd office is moving towards a "Contractors-Only" office. The best people have moved out & the best projects have been re-allocated to other offices. There's no actual meaty problem to solve otherwise  - People don't question (enough). As a an employee I remember one of the biggest culture drivers & work was people being really passionate about problems to solve. I guess that fire has burned out.  - Weak Management. An employee would expect a manager to advocate for his / her projects globally.

Product Marketing Manager at Google Perks aside, here's a take on the pros of being a marketer at Google: 1. Opportunity to get on high impact and/or high reach projects, whether it's user or advertising products. When you announce something at Google, people pay attention, something that is definitely gratifying as a marketer. 2. Overall, most cross functional teams are pretty cool, whether it be working with BD, engineering, product, sales, or PR. 90% of the time one can learn a great deal from colleagues of a different group. The company is huge. Getting things done is an increasing problem, and wading through many layers of bureaucracy, approvals, executive changes-of-mind are a constant challenge that impedes one from actually shipping -- even on the business side.	0.18322088538672332	0.20722227537855292	0.1871400445856551	0.23635671131391853	0.18606008333515023

The quantity and quality of courses available really allows anyone to grow and improve their understanding. - Lots of people who help you succeed!

Microsoft really offers a wide variety of problems to work on (from games to enterprise software to search to mobile phones to operating systems to ...) - People are really competitive here. If you are in a team of more senior people, then you don't have to worry much but if you are in a team with more junior people (i.e. ones who are closer to your level), then it can get messy really quick as everyone is trying to proof how their contributions matter the most. - Frequent reorgs and changes in strategy.

Former genius I made a lot of good friends I still keep in touch with. I became a certified mac technician and got to go to Cupertino to do it. That is about it. I WISH I COULD SAY ZERO STARS. Awful pay they cap what you can make after so many years of being there and unless you move to manager you never will get a raise again They did a way with with the Genius role Work life balance is a joke it was a cage match trying to get time off and if you didn’t get what you needed people would call out sick anyway. Managers did not care and always put the customer first Even if you or the normal protocol was being followed They also would provide passive aggressive advice or fearless feedback how to do better Discount is awful as retail does not make enough to afford anything even with the discount The watches came out and t was 50% off for a month that was a joke.

Fun but... How many times can you say that you're part of an organization that is indeed changing the world?! That is what Google is doing. Although you are one of many, many and more than likely have virtually nothing to do with changing the world, it's fun to be part of history. Google is such a great work environment that you will likely stay longer than you should. Many careers stall at Google because everyone just wants to keep working there. They won't take chances when they need to be challenged and get more experience to advance their career. Maybe the worse thing you could do START your career at Google because it will ruin the next job for you :) Be prepared to have your career go through Mountain View or New York.

Burn Out Don't get me wrong, Amazon is a great company to work for. Amazon pay and benefits are above average. If you like the fast pace, ever changing environment, you are young, and straight out of college with no experience this would be a place for you. But, be fair warned there is a price to pay. You heard of dog years? One human year is 7 years to a dog, well I would say the same for Amazon. People have aged years over night. Political environment is the biggest con, but there is also a hire turn over in all departments: floor associates, managers, and extremely high in HR department. They will run you into the ground and then ask what is wrong. They will put the job of 2 or 3 people on one person and expect you to have a work life balance.	0.09195828591396207	0.2371555794623226	0.2171670254917297	0.3238097845868647	0.12990932454512089
Career focus outweighs customer focus, but pockets of great culture Brilliant people, mature process, agility within the company to move positions, disciplines and jobs, world class training opportunities Broken review system, employees are encouraged more to manage perception and focus more on "what can make me look good" rather than being encouraged to focus on building world class customer experiences.

Plenty of rote, unexciting work, twenty+ year old codebases Hours were flexible, manager did not micromanage, bright coworkers, excellent health insurance, if you are lucky (and very talented), you might get to work on something very interesting. The company is huge and moving around from team to team can expose one to a variety of technologies. Disclosure: I was working on a very old piece of software and had little exposure to some of the newer projects at MS. Furthermore, I found the weather unbearably gloomy (Seattle), which no doubt played a role in my overall dissatisfaction.  Relatively few employees really get to contribute meaningfully (the rest are primarily engaged in useless work). The salary was relatively low. There was no feeling of passion of any kind in 80% of my coworkers. Internal "morale" meetings were a joke.  There is an excessive focus on individual features as opposed to providing a cohesive user experience.	0.1922120301499819	0.20215443629088087	0.21078226881165008	0.21176108802110785	0.1830901767263794

Account manager for small and medium business Great salary & benefits, fun, young, international work environment, amazing work culture Despite the work culture, Google still is a corporation and does act like one of them in pactice. Meaning that when it comes to, e.g., internal re-Orgs or cuts on people, they don't consider the actual impact on employees, who, like myself, can be shifted from the role they were hired for to another role they would have never considered. During the reorg back in 2012 I didn't have any chance but to accept a new role which I never felt motivated for.

It's utopia, until you work there Travelling business class to San Fran, great pay, access to latest technology Saw hard working employees get bullied by managers with HR doing nothing about it, complained about sexist comments from a male manager to HR and was 'conveniently' made redundant 6 weeks later. Happens all the time within the AU HO, and HR do nothing about it. This person then went on to take over my role, which in the end I discovered he was stabbing me in the back the whole time to get it, it's a toxic culture where people walk over you to be promoted and will steal your ideas to make themselves look good.

Tough to get in, great place to be Pro’s Full of intelligent people, no one is negative and everyone is challenged which creates a very positive environment. The work is good, challenging and what you make of it. Travel is common if you're into that. Great support networks for different groups (Glamazon, Parents). It’s common for people to move around within the org, and that’s seen as a good thing = you learn more, customers get a better experience and the business grows. Great building and environment, free fruit, great food, fuse ball tables, lovely seating areas to work in, great views and good quality office equipment – best office I’ve worked in. Compensation is very good and structured to have a good shares package (dependant on level I’m sure) so you think long term (one of the Amazon behaviours). Long hours Expectations are high A huge doc writing culture, meaning a lot of time is spent writing a short update (sometimes days) for someone to read it and not even question or seem interested. Roles are sometimes unclear as the business is growing so fast, on one hand this is good if you suit it, but I can see it giving some people uncertainty and not suiting it.	0.12216062256262143	0.21835847998108554	0.2299143616840295	0.22748682920557764	0.20207970656668592

An innovative, exciting company with an amazing culture Amazon is really an exciting place to work, you should never have a shortage of engaging work here. I expect that almost every possible type of job can be found here, if it isn't, it could be created. At Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I work, you would be hard-pressed to find more interesting, challenging, and future-thinking technology. One of my favorite things about working at Amazon in general is the inclusion--Amazon proudly employs, and vocally supports, minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals (including transgender persons), veterans, and people with disabilities. My entire management hierarchy, including myself, is made up of women (until reaching the CEO, Andy Jassy, who is male). As a young employee, I feel like my opinions are valued, and that I'm not looked down on due to my age or tenure. If you're hard-working, tenacious, and incredulous, you can find a place at Amazon. Amazon is an extremely fast-moving workplace, which is exciting, but it can also be exhausting if you don't know how to manage the pace. It is critical to set a work/life balance for yourself (or as Jeff Bezos says, work/life harmony). Management also plays a huge part in how much people enjoy working at Amazon. I have heard of people having night and day experiences on two similar teams, or even the same team, due to a change in management. The process to be promoted can also extremely vary across organizations, and there is a lack of inconsistency in who is promoted, after what time period. You need to be an advocate for yourself when you work at Amazon (but I've found many mentors who helped me grow this skill, personally and professionally, during my time here).	0.18746702928758952	0.19505525337478954	0.21568364708811416	0.21398870325518313	0.18780536699432362

Great Place To Work Management is very flexible and supportive. I'm taking graduate courses and leadership has navigated around that schedule to ensure I can continue my higher education.

Fall is intense, Amazon delivers the best experience possible for customers during the holiday season and that doesn't come without hard work.	0.16899283924802283	0.2295789116815887	0.1944288125720138	0.2043799622924489	0.20261947420592574

Can be amazing for some people, horrible for others Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too. There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams. The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.   - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived. You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned. There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.   - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)   - A chance to make a huge difference   - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself   - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).   - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain - You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that. - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.  I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.	0.12862648425952275	0.2981380975865108	0.20238071140001396	0.06180911779232542	0.3090455889616271

Open, fast, no bs It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true, it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a "need to know" basis, etc.  This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.  It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.  One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.  They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.  The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.  Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.  You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.  FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.  Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.  The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it. FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.  FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.  FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and "get with the program" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.	0.17340498017410413	0.2364257517497943	0.22448196377279692	0.23847997048140446	0.1272073338219002

Overall positive - The people you work with are without a doubt the most incredible, passionate, interesting, talented, intelligent people you will work with in your life. - The company has an amazing philosophy in regards to its effect on the environment, it's passionate towards individuality, and has a desire to make the work a better place. - Working here will open doors throughout your career, both within and outside of Apple. People are always interested when they hear you work for Apple. - Busy environment - there was never a day spent waiting for things to happen. This made the days go quickly and I went home knowing that I had achieved something that day. - Employees are looked after well, with fitness and health reimbursements, good discount, and personal support for any issues faces within life. - During busy periods i.e. launches and holiday seasons, you are kept motivated and looked after by the leadership team. - The opportunity to try out new roles both within retail and corporate. - Excellent environment for open communication and feedback. - The ability to develop yourself is phenomenal here, particularly for students and graduates. - Although when compared to other retail jobs the pay is higher than average, when you assess the work and effort you put into each role, the general consensus is that staff are underpaid. However, roles within management have an excellent pay. - Busy - not a great environment to work in whilst ill, or going through personal issues. On days like these work can be relentless. - Customers spend a lot of money on Apple products, and quite rightly when things go wrong they aren't too happy with this. Dealing with people in this situation is not easy and can be extremely tiring. - Job has become quite measures bases. Apple has lost it's original core value of creating great experiences. It is now heavily focussed on revenue and iPhone upgrade. - As with any retail role the hours are very unsociable. It is difficult to plan any personal social activity in advance due to a lack of knowledge of which day you will have off.	0.14540699516107675	0.2552717952654776	0.21445484530103215	0.2189820847206791	0.16588427955173438

Reno office mentality unstable Hours and work are flexible and work can be interesting and exciting. At the beginning it seems like such an innovative company but you soon realize it is anything but interesting. Once you reach a level of proficiency and mastery, you are no longer useful to them. You can easily go from a high or even just very good performer to the bottom of the heap in a matter of one quarter. The managers are untrained and ill equipped for management. They have no ability to be honest or forthright.  The joke around the office is that it is not a matter of "if" you will get fired, it's a matter of "when." Everyone has a shelf life and it's just a matter of when you have hit yours.  Such a horrible and toxic environment. There are therapists in Reno that specialize in MS employees because there is such a demand for it.  My advice is to get out when you can!

The people you work with are vibrant and interesting I loved my experience with Apple. I started out at their corporate headquarters in Austin, and worked for three retail stores afterwards. The coworkers have completely made the experience for me. I have met so many passionate people and made many lasting friendships.  They pay well above minimum wage, most likely the highest of any retail store. There are goals, but no commission, so the pressure is not on you to force the customers into something they do not want. Managers treat employees very fairly, and have shown great compassion when real life gets in the way of work life.  They have the best benefits package of any company I have ever worked for. Great discounts on products, and employee stock purchase discounts too.  You have the opportunity to make lateral moves within the company to find our what role makes you happiest.  Apple was a job, not a career for me. It didn't pay me more than I made in other, more corporate settings. But if happiness had a price, this company was better to me than any other. If you wanted to start at the entry level and move to management, it would take many, many years, if at all. If you want to be a retail store manager, you would have to be a manager somewhere else first, and be at the top of your game.  There is no set schedule for 90% of the employees. It can be difficult to take vacations around the holidays.  If you cannot handle tons of crowds and talking to people all day long, this would not be the job for you. It can be mentally and socially exhausting at the end of the day. Entitled customers break their own gadgets and get mad at you for it. That is one of the worst parts.	0.12101297516698153	0.3136744862407551	0.07865843385853799	0.317367475342524	0.16928662939120126

Good training provided plus review of your work is done on weekly or monthly bases, gives you feedback right away and provide training if necessary. Nice offices create pleasant place to work in. Good place to work. Workload can be overwhelming.

One of the best jobs you could want The amount of pros here is ridiculous. You have really nice, smart people as co-workers. The work is insanely interesting and challenging. Lots of room for growth. Free food, insane perks, fantastic pays, etc. Working with smart people is a pro and a con. It's easy to stress out about not being the smarted person there. You'll often feel you have to work extra hard to keep up, but thats something you overcome when you realize you wouldn't be there if you aren't qualified.  The area described above often affects work/life balance... because people feel this way they tend to work a lot so then you feel like you do too. After a while you find a good balance, but its easy to fall into the trap of constantly being involved in work.	0.21879142003063137	0.2111114542691294	0.16537812950901015	0.20265403378191418	0.20206496240931493
Community Operations - Hyderabad Facilities given to the employee, to travel to work and at work are very good. They try to provide a very comfortable enviornment to work. 1. The Hiring department of the company is below par. Only importance is given to Work experience not essentially in the area of expertise required. Employees coming from Premier graduation and Post graduate insitutes are considered at the same level as that of candidates from local institutes(probably done to save cost of relcoation, not expected of such a big brand) 2. The talent across Hyderabad floor and across international offices (I have visited 2) are extremely mediocre, essentially because of point number 1. 3. The attitude of collaboration and working as a team, is severly lacking in most hires in the company. 4. The middle and senior management is hogwash and power rests in the hands of 1/2 managers who play office politics well. 5. Middle level managers are totally impotent, Because essentially they have no power which is attributed to managers in a usual organizational set up.	0.24704476336434333	0.15827224661794057	0.1604043167866194	0.31001761522360716	0.12426105800748956

Apathetic Executives, Inconsistent Management, Great Peers My peers were all a pleasure to work with. Generally people want to work well together and motivate each other to do their best. I didn't experience any of the cutthroat backstabbing you hear in some extreme reviews. However, I know many people who have felt betrayed by others. Amazon is a good place to make connections, but I don't find it to be the type of company you want to settle down with for more than 2-3 years. In my experience, managers were constantly changing, and the lack of consistent face time made it difficult to build trust (ironic since that's one of Amazon's leadership requirements). Executives live in their own world and cannot empathize with or relate to their employees.	0.19553194288377382	0.20344661569021968	0.19408345765009533	0.2378626278953648	0.16907535588054626

Only the strong survive You will learn a lot and work with some of the smartest people in any industry. You will learn and grow as a professional here as you are thrown into the work.  Amazon is a disruptor and it is exciting to be at a company that is constantly innovating and disrupting industry it enters. Lack of support by upper management. Upper management expects you to autonomously drive innovations which sounds great in theory. However in reality it means being thrown into a project and not having enough background or support to drive it to a success. You will constantly be fighting with other teams for resources, for support/buy in, for them to give a crap about what you are working on.

No place for junior-mid level engineers - The work culture / leadership principles - made me a better professional - An insight into doing things massively, properly, at scale, and leading the industry - Managers are usually ex-engineers. I've had 3 managers and they all have been fantastic - An obvious one: Amazon is killing it lately and looks great on your resume. The long-term prospects are also good. - Things do change internally - Loved the corporate events and outings - shout out to the events team - The nature of work itself in operations is absolutely horrendous. The only good thing about the role was transitioning out of the role: literally, every conversation I had with my managers, where I raised concerns, was turned into "Work harder and get promoted out of this" talk. Engineering-wise, this has been the most demotivational role in my career. - Stress-driven operations. You're subjected to stress and that's how it's all meant to work. - You're pushed to work extra: while it is not explicit, the annual performance reviews, career progression and customer obsession are designed in such a way, that you will fail without going overtime. I had committed a bulk of my personal time to get promoted once, succeeded – and it was totally not worth it. Very little had changed in terms of my work (or compensation for that matter), and the conversations with my manager then turned into "Now, work harder and get promoted into the next thing" (goto con #1). - Pigeonhole - it's a big corporation and the roles are very well defined and specialized. I think you can really boil down any job spec to 3 main responsibilities that you will do day-to-day. Training is advertised and provided, however it will likely be after hours for you, as your time is already 120% full, and training is not how things are learned anyway – it's training+PRACTICE, and you won't be practising any of that at work – you will be right back in your pigeonhole after the training. - An unpleasant surprise (or, borderline dirty move) in the way the stock benefits are accounted for in your annual reviews.  Overall, I would strongly recommend against getting on board if you're a junior or mid level professional – you will get way more technical experience and interesting projects in other companies. Here you will be selling your time for a big name on your resume (and then recovering your rusty technical skills later).	0.19825136335098	0.1712599545187287	0.173566980847862	0.3354574400612659	0.12146426122116337

Absolutely amazing - This is what every company should aspire to be like casual and comfortable, free gourmet food, recreational equipment, genuinely friendly people, smart coworkers who work hard and won't give you the "could you explain __?" stall tactic (or they're bright enough they're never confused about what you mean) once you're in, Google likes to keep employees and it's easy to move laterally to another position if the one you're in has its project cut or something very rigid upper management structure and company policies. even if someone can do more, you're limited by your role, access, etc. as typical at large companies, departments are very compartmentalized and there's not too much cross-functional interaction. Google also tends to hire more based on credentials first, personality second, and experience third.

From day one we get access to every piece of code and the company trusts us to contribute our best without being afraid of breaking some code in the process. Exorbitant amount of power with respect to choice is given to each employee from choosing his his/her own team to the areas within the team they want to work on. This results in a deep sense of trust and ownership which drives each and every employee to contribute to their limits.

Sr. Human Resources Assistant- Don't do it unless you know what you are signing up for Everyone is going through the same thing and you make decent money. All in all, I completely regret working for Amazon in a fulfillment center setting. I read all of these articles about how great it is to work at Amazon and I am upset because I, like many others in management, were treated poorly and basically tricked into taking this job. I was recruited out of college and waited for several months to find out my location. I was contacted by my future HRBP on LinkedIn telling me that I was placed on his team (rather than the recruiter who was supposed to tell me officially through email). I was placed into one of the largest and high-volume FC's in the US. First of all, the location was remote and though they offered re-location, there was not suitable housing around the FC. I received little to no training, and had to follow around other Sr. HRAs and figure it out as best I could. After the week or so of horrible training on day-shift, I was given a Back-half nights shift. That is Wed-Sat 5pm-3:30am. I was extremely distressed by this, not only because I obviously did not think I would get this shift, but also because my entire team was made up of other members who had literally just graduated as well. Also, BHN is notorious for having the craziest FC workers (we are talking about drunk people on the floor, mental breaks, you name it.) I indicated to my management that I was not happy on this shift and it was effecting my happiness. They told me that they would try to get me on a different shift ASAP. I was also dispealsed to find out that vacation, and personal time were tracked like FC associates. There was basically no flexibility and even if I wanted to use my time, I had to go through my manager first because we were so short-staffed in HR. After 4 months or so, they brought on several new team members and gave them more desirable shifts. I was given excuses that contradicted everything I was told previously on how they determine shifts. I attempted to apply to other shifts through formal methods and to other FC's, but was blocked by my manager because they "did not want to lose me on my shift." After 6 months I realized that I just could not do it anymore, and that my health and happiness were more important than the Amazon name. I quickly found a new job and am so happy to leave the FC behind. My advice- ask questions and don't be fooled by the Amazon name. If it is in a Fulfillment Center you probably do not want the job. Corporate is most likely a different story.	0.11267332165476654	0.1673263581355845	0.24790957017936252	0.32775246211337383	0.1443382879169126
Better the devil you know The company isn't going anywhere so no chance of getting laid off. I can wear whatever I want to work which is something I never expected to appreciate as much as I do. The pay is good and benefits are competitive. I like the people I work with. The environment is aggressive and toothy. It's not as described in the New York Times article, but there are some people who get away with being bullies. They are often people in senior roles and keep it just under what is egregious and so it's hard to do anything about it. And, I believe that calling out a senior leader would be career ending. I'm not a newbie - I've been here close to 10 years, so I am used to it. But, it's demoralizing and frustrating.	0.17341884377851596	0.15938607790551304	0.2023599102224284	0.21762410848499109	0.24721105960855144

I've had positive roles where I had a lot of autonomy and was well-rewarded, and dead-end-ish work that only yields frustration and poor reviews. The best I can say is that most engineering work is really positioning yourself so that you can do well and avoid toxic situations.  The company does seem to recognize that big tech companies grind people down, and it tries to dilute the politics with one-on-one's, annual reviews, sabbaticals, etc., although most feel it is only partially successful. However I'd rate it as better than most. They also emphasize diversity, ethics and good business practices internally.  Some groups and products are doing well and getting better. Low autonomy and creativity. MS actually missed out on a patent from me because they gave me no support for the work.  Typical big-company tendencies such as fads, not-invented-here and blame-shifting. Some tools have been described (in anonymous internal polls) as at least 5 years behind, it's painful to sit and watch sometimes (actually all the time).  Dogfooding instead of using the best technology. "Nobody else is using it at this scale" -- Azure support for a tool that replaced something much cheaper and higher-functioning.	0.19213690331744734	0.18911723260491387	0.17927602238158613	0.2633595414259411	0.1761103002701117
New and exciting, but beware of the burnout! I love being surrounded by brilliant people and pure, raw passion. It's one of the best parts about Amazon. The other great part about Amazon is the culture: anyone can be a leader. There are lots of opportunities, once you're in, to be a go-getter and stretch yourself and work on projects that interest you. (The hard part about that is that those opportunities are sometimes hard to get with all the competition to work for Amazon, and once in Amazon, to do something amazing.) Other positives: The benefits are no joke, and I haven't run out of vacation or personal days or sick time yet. (Granted, I don't often use them.) My managers have been exceptionally understanding people with the brains to earn my trust. And let's not forget: you can bring your dog to work (if you're at corporate). Kind of hard to beat. Three of my 4 managers were very flexible and allowed me to work a flexible schedule with the expectation that as long as I got my work done, everybody was happy. Their trust in me caused me to put everything and more into my work to deliver my very best. Burnout is real, y'all. With the continual desire to "raise the bar," the result is people who stay later, who have more papers that say they're educated, who put work before family, or who move faster than is wise. I equate it to a locomotive with a bunch of competitive clowns at the helm. Scary, fast, and dangerous.  Most of the folks in my department experience stress 22/7 (it's not always crazy. A couple of hours a day, we all laugh about how stressed we are). We never seem to have enough people to do the work that we do, but there's more work to be done and more projects that will increase that workload. It's not a very sustainable model.  Other cons include the fluidity of roles. While this is also a pro, it can be a con since sometimes people have managers weaving in and out of roles so fast, it can be hard to get a foothold. When you have a new manager, priorities shift, and let's face it-- it's hard to get a promotion from a stranger.	0.12940905980705691	0.248740680958674	0.20361201455617167	0.25801998253118663	0.1602182621469107

Great exp. but don't expect to be properly reward Apple is great to build experience with sales. Encouraging management. Clearly articulated goals. Amazing onboarding and training program. Discounts. Camaraderie amongst co-workers. Engaging with customers and helping them learn something new. Little room for growth. Don't expect to start as a specialist and move to genius. They're two different worlds according to management. Often found that although I was better at helping/repairing software/hardware issues, got stuck in specialist position and told to focus on sales. You end up selling $10k+ a day with no commission.	0.19855779453200506	0.21689737152374833	0.1679253884009408	0.24230336146837994	0.17431608407492585
Hardest job I've ever worked. Amazon offers great health benefits. Work weeks are 4 days. Eating utensils and condiments are free in the break rooms, also multiple microwaves. Rest rooms are always clean. Kiosks throughout the building where employees can check schedules and time off. Amazon will pay majority of tuition in a highly desirable technical field, after working with them for a year. Growth opportunities are offered. Amazon is safety-oriented. I was a stower and production rate requirements are incredibly high. Trainer didn't inform us of expected rates, only to focus on quality, so I was completely thrown off when the manager confronted me. Amazon doesn't give raises after three years. Bins can be very disorganized which decreases production making it difficult to find ample space. This results in either re-organizing bins or walking around trying to find less cramped ones, especially for large items. Facility is huge which cuts into break/lunch times. After being "retrained" I wore myself out and worked harder than I ever have but still couldn't attain quota. My guess is people stow how they want which creates messy bins. I was very sore at the end of each shift although I did lose some weight. Amazon states they're "customer obsessed" which is very enticing and probably reflects why employees are expected to work super hard, resulting in high turnover and a pool of new hires constantly. After all, someone is always looking for a job. I wouldn't have applied had I known Amazon's requirements. I found out about a documentary, "Amazon Rising" on CNBC after it was too late.	0.19995807250324354	0.2000468359299708	0.19928073974514404	0.219707439136872	0.18100691268476973

Some people come dressed as Ninjas or wizards. - Good shuttle service to many locations in the SF Bay with free Wifi. - Extremely high burnout rate. Some products have teams where the overwhelming majority of people (>60%) have been at the company less than 3 years (high turnover). Hearing that someone has been at Apple for 5 years is rare and garners respect/admiration. - Zero work-life balance. Expect to work until late every night and then be “on-call” to answer emails/calls at any hour. If in Operations, expect to work both California and Asia working hours in the same day (9am-1am). - Travel a lot to be on-site. Essential but draining. When you fly overseas, it’s expected that you land in the morning so you can work the second you get there. When you fly home, it’s expected that you take a flight to land in SFO at 8am so you can be at work that day. Also, common for last minute travel. Had a couple instances of getting a call on Saturday and was on a flight to Asia on Sunday. Stay there until job is done. - 90 days a calendar year is the limit to be in a certain Asian country for business purposes. “Strongly recommended” that employees apply for a work-permit/visa so that you can stay there longer. - Extremely fast paced. Very common to get an email/text on a Sunday afternoon and it’s expected that you have a presentation done and sent by dinner time (Sunday night Pacific time is Monday morning in Asia). - Working with Asia means getting calls at all hours. - Lots of politics between teams/orgs. Some teams (Industrial Design and Product Design especially) are higher in the totem pole and treat the other teams with annoyance (at best) to belittlement (“Just get it f***ing done, Engineering PMs! I don’t care about supplier capabilities.”).	0.14512781591332924	0.21035014645824637	0.2352287290157868	0.24289196999816876	0.1664013386144689

Difficult yet satisfying. If you are someone who likes challenging, fast-paced environments with the autonomy to approach your goals in your own way, then this will be where you want to go.  I love working here because every day is a new and rewarding challenge and there is always more to be done so you are never bored. Work-Life balance is definitely achievable but you need to set expectations around that and stick to them. No one is going to hold your hand here you are in control of your own situation. That doesn't mean others won't help (they definitely will) you simply need to be the one reaching out and speaking up because they have just as much on their plates as you do. For those that want to put their feet up or meander through every work day this is not the place for you. You will be expected to work hard and accomplish a lot.	0.12967584882910166	0.19800584155649503	0.20449465151331123	0.27035513584252735	0.19746852225856482
AOS Chat Apple is hands down the best company to work for. The training and resources available were impeccable. The opportunity for growth was substantial and managers would even work with you to help you create both professional and personal growth. The culture is great, even though it's one of the largest companies in the world, you felt like you were a part of a family. And everybody that I worked with or came in contact with were nothing short of amazing people. I wished that I still worked there, and if my unforeseen circumstances didn't arise I would have definitely never left. Maybe offer slightly deeper discounts on products and better scheduling options for online and retail employees. I come from the hospitality industry originally, and the only thing I could say that can use some vast improvement is the scheduling, because there is a way to give a better work life balance to all employees especially when you have a dedicated team that handles scheduling. Some things didn't make sense with how the folks were managing our time in regards to scheduling our training and time off.	0.1780626663695907	0.20138834504154451	0.18977247922879406	0.21661142996928312	0.21416507939078763
The new IBM Fairly decent job stability, and much more work/life balance friendly than the old 'sleep under your desk' days. Bloated middle management still left over from the old days, so protectionism and fear of failure drive all major decisions, relegating this once megastar company to the trash heap of 'us too' products and acquisitions to try and stay relevant. The product lines are stale, and the stock is stagnant. Buying other companies' IP is the only thing keeping the company alive.	0.19844270787107943	0.20647520159287658	0.19697265991961355	0.22651715285163798	0.17159227776479233

Disneyland 4 months paid leave with newborns, work from home Wednesdays, unlimited high quality food, can always walk in the park on the roof if I need some fresh air. Food is consistently great. The only legitimate con I have about working here is meeting start times. Meetings go from 12:00-1:00 for example, with the following meeting starting at 1:00 promptly. This naturally leads to people starting meetings late.  Also I get withdrawals on the weekends when at home because the food here is so good. It causes me to eat out more on the weekends and thus I don't actually save on my food bill.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Great potential, but culture unable to change fast enough. Microsoft has some great technologies, great people, and great passion internally. The benefits are outstanding and overall compensation is very good. You have the opportunity to work on projects that will impact millions or potentially hundreds of millions of people. Microsoft can't change it's corporate culture to deal with the 21st century. It moves too slow and is too insular from customers and what else is going on. There is quite a sense of entitlement among employees, especially those that have been there a long time. Both in terms of how they expect to work, but also very much a "if we build it, they will come" mentality.	0.18057853160391685	0.2156187193918441	0.1871262206898249	0.22554610322603494	0.19113042508837919

Support Specialist at Genius Bar (Retail) The benefit of working with Apple is you can use their name to go elsewhere to pursue your dreams and career aspirations. Within retail they DO NOT promote or hire enough diversity. Everyone wants to wear a hat but I feel that managers are not supportive in your career goals within the company. The environment often at times feels like you are in grade school again and there is no real work/life balance. You may have a better opportunity working with Apple on a corporate level.	0.11223325020715266	0.26499145192181645	0.2175777782437477	0.23398987459717038	0.17120764503011268

Amazon is a company I am proud to work for. I transitioned from the military to corporate America two years ago when my son was born, and to be honest I really missed the culture of brotherhood in the military.  THEN I came to Amazon and it feels like being home. The work is challenging but I have never felt that I am in it alone because my brothers and sisters (peers) are always there to help. My GM and Senior OPS team have set an amazing culture and I am truly looking forward to Working Hard, Having Fun, and Making History with Amazon for the years to come.

After working for 3 other tech companies, Amazon is by far the best Work in Softlines Tech after positions at AT&T, Zynga, and a tech startup and the main pain points I had in previous positions are resolved here:  - Overall good morale and positive internal view of leadership due to the company's rapid growth and amazing new areas/products - No bureaucracy (free to spin up the AWS hardware and services needed to do my job) - Best management I've worked for (3 levels up are all former engineers themselves who respect engineers and trust us to do our job without micromanaging) - High hiring bar = great teammates - The most clear and objective method for promotion of any company I've been in - As a new dad, work/life balance is incredibly good working regular 9-5 hours, work from home Wednesdays, and management being super flexible about random family needs that come up. - Not as many perks as Facebook or Google but seriously, after having worked at Zynga where we had as many perks as you could want, it really isn't as important as the pros I mentioned above and seriously heard more complaints from coworkers at Zynga about the perks than appreciation.	0.17569127997811268	0.20994694241654446	0.18688918573495844	0.1938611097016863	0.23361148216869806

I came to Apple inspired, I left Apple feeling beatdown The benefits are the only pro. Great healthcare, 401k, employee discount, decent pay Schedules change and the available shifts are never consistent. In over 5 years, nobody would explain how you rank for shift bids, so you never knew what you’d get. HIGH STRESS! This isn’t a job for people prone to anxiety/depression. Working from home causes isolation issues, add the job stress you have the perfect mental health crisis. I don’t know one long-term AppleCare employee that didn’t take a leave of absence for mental/physical health. Typical call center metrics and monitoring. Once you hit Sr. Advisor, that’s as far as you can go from home. They’ll say there a multitude of opportunities but that’s not true. They do offer a Team Manager apprentice. So you get to do the job of an AppleCare manager but you don’t get paid for it. This job is nothing but another glorified call center job.	0.1677467250639445	0.25271729770142676	0.2145569857485113	0.23394716120063597	0.1310318302854816

A great company to work for with a few glaring flaws. Great co-workers, challenging environment that will build personal & job skills like at no other company. The wealth of personal and job growth someone can have working at Apple is unrivaled at any other company. Apple employees, due to excellent training and a stringent selection process are highly skilled and personally well rounded, if not from the moment of hire, they will become that way within the first year of working in the Apple environment. Apple provides a sort of education that can't be learned anywhere else.  Employees are paid well for retail. There are frequent opportunities for lateral movement in the store, and opportunities to "intern" or work temporarily at corporate. In a crowded retail environment where employees often get sick from their customers / the public, Apple has an attendance policy that severely punishes employees for taking sick days. Because of this, most employees come to work sick [and sometimes injured], especially during flu season and the holidays, to avoid being penalized. This, in turn, gets more people sick. During the holidays, 30-50% of the employees in the store will be at some degree of ill, many repeatedly re-catching illness from other co-workers.  Upwards mobility is limited. Apple often hires outside manager candidates with little or no experience working in the store and places them in a position to manage people far more experience than them. Apple also has policies in place to prevent managers from building a human connection with the people they manage, such as preventing the few internally hired managers from working with previous co-workers, and preventing managers from having any social interaction with non-management employees outside the store. As a result, managers form their own "social click" like the the "cool kids in high school" that is entirely detached from the rest of the store.	0.20834753968520106	0.2215598226896284	0.21101035798169576	0.19563934893346385	0.1634429307100109

I like my job I think the best things about working here is the shift times ,the wage and the fact that you can request to work any schedule to suit your needs. I work three doubles and am off 4 days. Shifts here are 4hr and being p\t I can only work up to 6 shifts a week. I was originally a p\t seasonal employee but when conversion to blue badge was offered,I was only 2days past my 90 and was sitting on 4 attendance points . Conversion was only open for 1 week,I put in for it and was hired. My wage went up and I have better benefits. My job is a fulfillment associate 1 in the sort center. I basically put boxes and packages on pallets that will be sent to various post offices for delivery. It is hard work and you are walking ,walking, walking . You do have a quota and you will slim down and firm up. Working your bottom off while a lot of the young people barely work and talk the whole shift. Another con is some of the people who think they have more authority than they do and can be very rude.There is way too many passive aggressive people here,it can get on your nerves. Another thing that irritates me is when they call VTO ,people leave and then the rest of us get a longer shift	0.2222930493369393	0.2223917274875625	0.17426537680725068	0.2442483866559228	0.13680145971232482

Don All the coffee, tea, soda, milk, water, and juice you can consume. Cafeterias are a cut above with loads of options reasonably priced. Flexible work hours can be arranged. People are generally very smart. The attitude that you will meet your deadlines no matter what goes wrong or who is responsible prevails and is exhausting. Demands sometimes feel inhumane - succeeding always feels good, but should not be so costly. One often feels they are not living their life and enjoying their job, only surviving to make the company bigger, better, brighter, stronger, and faster. Remember this - you are not important to them, no matter how you feel or what they tell you - you are not important to them. What you can DO for them is important to them, but YOU are not important to them.	0.13846251717706132	0.14737578898719447	0.21463890774605562	0.2886740513249819	0.2108487347647066

great place to work Great workplace, I have been working at amazon for approximately 1 month and I love it. I feel that Amazon genuinely cares about their employees and making sure they get home safely. Even though it is a fast pace workplace environment I do not feel that the managers are trying to rush everyone to work faster. I also like that all of the managers are very understanding, if you make a mistake they work to make sure you don't make it again they do not punish you for making one. It is hard work, and can be pretty rough on your body.	0.19173562103463018	0.2180600696401675	0.1723095624894494	0.21495528095664088	0.20293946587911207

Like they have said " It's always day one at Amazon " Work place inspires you everyday to come to work everyday a new challenge set and with this it makes work more fun and interesting.

Easy tech job, well paying Microsoft is fairly easy work-wise compared to other tech companies in the sector. If you're looking to have a life and get a pretty good paycheck, you should work here. If you want to make huge blazing changes in the industry, don't bother unless you are very senior -- too large of a company to make any real change Due to its size, there's a lot of employee redundancy and bloat.

And I DROVE here!!" when in fact everyone else is in the same boat and so many companies don't even come close to Apple's free technical support so the privilege gets abused.

Smart, self-directed employees, great culture, occasionally disruptive reorgs Getting to work with smart people is great.  Most people are self-starters who are driven to accomplishment and Apple culture reinforces that drive.  In some teams resources are easy to get as long as you provide the product or customer focused justification. Deep reorganization within a group did not consider the skills of the smaller teams or individuals well.  If you are used to being a big fish in a smaller pond, you'll need to become skilled at suppressing your ego.  Annual review process having only 3 levels and then adjusting those from upper management to 'balance' is insulting to the excellent people on my team, however, compensation is a much better received.	0.20746174106577805	0.22297060584175743	0.21611196034011404	0.2325858731826034	0.12086981956974699

Smartest people you can work with! - I joined Microsoft straight out of undergrad college as a software engineer in IT with a bunch of other college grads and I have met few of the smartest people I have known while at Microsoft! Especially the new college grads. They are super motivated, super techy, and politically smart. You will definitely learn a thing or two from everyone (and while this goes for every place you work at, Microsoft stands out for me personally) - There are lots of genuinely nice people here. Everyone is pretty transparent and honest, direct and challenging the status quo. - There are no meetings with just straight nods. Everyone has something useful to say and they would make a point to say it however radical, and you too will be expected to do so if you don't - A lot of parties, fun stuff. - Work - life balance. Your manager will literally want you to be happy. I have had about 6 managers in a span of 3 years and everyone of them was invested in getting me work where I could make and impact while also caring enough about what I do outside of work and whether I get enough time for it. - A lot of opportunities for innovation. Microsoft has a lot of internal groups and hackathons which promote this culture. And most of the crowd being into some side tech hobby or interest, they don't have to push a lot for participation here. There's a lot of cool stuff being built and you can literally be a part of it, everyone is just a ping away! - Compensation - Campus (its super beautiful) - Free snacks, coffee, and the like. - Hard to get noticed unless you are super good at what you do. Every team has a lot of smart people. If they are not technically as smart, they would be in other aspects like communication, management. Its hard to stand out, and a lot of effort sometimes sadly goes into impactless work just for the sake of annual reviews. - You may feel like a tiny nut in a huge machinery. It takes a lot of passion for tech to give in the kind of work people give in spite of this - Being restricted in some ways to the Microsoft stack (while the company is justified doing this, you could wonder time and again whether the grass is greener on the other side :P)	0.1986430246766058	0.24617159763241686	0.21762154103828338	0.20284037253895618	0.13472346411373776

Great culture, few higher level promotions AWS is an excellent place to learn, be creative, own your project and be part of something larger than you are. AWS prefers to hire from the outside vs. promote from within. Promotions to Level 6 (SDE III and Sr Product Manager) are commonplace, but promotions to Level 7 are few and far in between. Lots of Level 8 (Director) people are hired from the outside and most leave or are forced out within the first year.	0.18255995402587702	0.2064747639789953	0.20181278332005287	0.2237635885187808	0.1853889101562939
A Lot Of Physical Activity Flexible Schedule Friendly Staff They're not too strict, so far they're only strict about 15 minute breaks It gets kind of hot in there You're doing a lot of lifting and moving around so be prepared Sometimes it gets really busy and lines get backed up Because you don't get reprimanded much you will see people just standing around talking.	0.17233510259686857	0.163592204687681	0.22571603019160774	0.24034631980081234	0.19801034272303047
One of the best large companies to work for in the world. - amazing quality food and lots of it - supportive of growing their employees - generous benefits and amenities - the warm and friendly corporate culture has dwindled to resemble the more typical corporate culture with underhanded politics and favoritism being the keys to success - work / life balance could be better. a lot of times there is peer pressure to be constantly working or give off the perception that one is always on the clock. the company does provide a laptop, cell phone and pay for your home internet (which is obviously great) but it is also to enable this sort of mentality	0.18472737598322042	0.2100414264996077	0.19923605711334733	0.2176475571833307	0.18834758322049383

It's a great job, if you aren't a college graduate. Benefits starting day 1, company stock, paid time off, vacation, competitive pay. You also get Variable Compensation Pay which is extra money just for having a perfect attendance. The medical insurance is great and they provide medical leave/personal leave. If it wasn't for all the friends I made and the amazing co-workers, I would've left already. I've been in the hospital several times and have still been able to keep this job. The medical insurance is great and covered more than 80% of my hospital bills. The pay increases every year and it's enough for me to pay all of my bills and still have some leftover. Over worked, been working here for 8 months and my muscles still ache everyday. No work/life balance. A 40 hour week is rare. Usually working 55+ hours because of overtime. I only have 2 hours to myself after I come home from work to relax, eat and shower. It's hard to wake up in the morning sometimes because of how sore and tired I am from work the day before.	0.19100572123729903	0.21118397607090084	0.13461420162096235	0.24606432729561176	0.21713177377522597

AWS seems to operate a little differently than the consumer side - Very sharp people/lots of learning opportunities - Big emphasis on sharing of information and developing tools to streamline (innovate) - Great offices - onsite gyms, collaborative space, etc. No free lunch, but being downtown, there are lots of easy walkable options including onsite cafeterias - Great pace - things move quickly, but not so fast that quality suffers or that you can't have fun - The company overall seems a bit fragmented (AWS could easily be it's own entity) - Onsite cafeterias can get crowded depending on the bldg you're in, but I guess that's growing pains - Compensation is more complicated than it should be and relies heavily on equity grants and stock performance	0.19323092277671222	0.21364425268255557	0.17443896261662056	0.23266724009886988	0.18601862182524176

Love it / Hate it The work, at its best, is truly inspiring. It's really all about getting to do interesting projects that will touch millions of people. The fast pace provides an adrenaline rush that, deep down, I seriously enjoy. I'm not convinced that Apple cares about its employees, and things are getting worse all the time. In the last year, free dinner was moved from 5pm to 7pm, our free apples were taken away, and food prices were raised. A large, delicious salad from the salad bar used to cost $4, and overnight it went up to $7. I have little hope that things will be better when Apple Campus 2 opens next year.  Additionally, the campus (if you could call it that) is now so large that I often spend hours of my day just shuttling around to different meetings. My productivity suffers.	0.168165951816915	0.20296610262183046	0.2283209298617479	0.21830845134130003	0.18223856435820662
Not the actual Microsoft Big brand, good internal community, if you are lucky u might get opportunity to work with product groups. Some very nice people. Good opportunity to learn new technologies. From outside people see Microsoft as big product group company. But GD comes under service division of MS. Before you join make sure u understand that you would be working in services, Here system is like a typical service industry where we have to bill hours to customer. Everybody is just running behind hours.  Extremely competitive environment, people are compared among other, In fact this stack raking is a killer.  Lot of favoritism to managers,  work life balance is always a problem.  Very difficult to get appreciation. Most of the awards always goes to some specific people.  You might be put on projects which was failed 2-3 times earlier with some other vendors.  Migration and support projects  Billing rates of MS are very high because of which customer expectation is very high.	0.138501446219911	0.22967425543768816	0.2244884549259296	0.2318018011105469	0.17553404230592443

Large Portfolio makes Microsoft an excellent place to work 1. Smart people 2. Large portfolio of products/services. So, if you find out that you want to work in a different product because of your interest or experience, you can do so because you will find pretty much all the domains of computer science in the company. I have moved internally a couple of times. 3. Amazing benefits. Probably one of the best in the market (no free food like Google though) 4. Company encourages innovation via some internal programs where you can form a team in the company with as many people as you want and develop something cool and get noticed officially. 5. Lots of training programs for personal development  Bottomline, if you get a good manager, you can really excel. 1. To a certain level, there is politics involved in management. That can halt your personal growth. 2. Review system is not the best (though it has been updated in last year, don't know how will it work out yet) 3. To move internally, you have to go through a full interview loop, but you can't change your level or pay scale. Well, this makes sense from company's perspective, but one might think again. If you have to go through full interview loop, why not just try outside ? You might get a raise.	0.19043215312077952	0.2275619387057092	0.1389244127444515	0.21012647031471832	0.2329550251143414

Fulfilment Associate I’ve worked at Amazon for 2 weeks, and it isn’t what I was expecting from the reviews I have read. To clear some things up....you are of course allowed to go to the toilet whenever you need to, but if you are constantly going then they may ask why, just like any job. Yes it’s tiring, you’re on your feet all day, it is not an office job. Yes you have to walk to the canteen, it takes a few minutes but people leave their work stations a few minutes before their break starts to ensure they get their full allocation of break. You do have to go through a metal detector,, so just make sure you have no metal objects such as keys, coins etc in your pockets or on your clothing and you want get stopped. Yes there is compulsory overtime at Xmas, but they give you plenty of notice when it starts and if there is any problems you can always speak to a manager about your shifts. It is boring some days as you may just be packing or picking, but the day does go quick and to be honest I get paid more at amazon for packing boxes then I did in a call centre & I don’t get shouted at by rude customers. The managers are really helpful, so are HR . It really isn’t as bad as people make out, as long as you are prepared to work hard be be on your feet. So here are some tips: Drink plenty of water throughout the day On every break have something to eat Wear comfortable clothing and shoes Get plenty of sleep every night and you will be fine!

Solid blue chip, interesting times ahead Microsoft has been a global top 10 technology company for decades. All this time it has been very profitable thanks to the Windows and Office franchises and more recently the growing cloud business. It has been able to hire very smart people and acquire any company it wants. This leads into an environment, where everything is possible as long as you can sell the idea internally. For the same reason that it has been so profitable for decades, most of its employees are anchored in businesses, which are being disrupted. People are very aware of this, but not able to change it, having to continue milking the cow. This leaves a big part of the company operating as if one hand is tied behind your back, which means that even smart people will have trouble against more nimble competition. Regarding career opportunities, while there are plenty, you really must be willing to relocate to Redmond, so less promising if you are not.	0.18541086544815022	0.20969913630193884	0.20496435274390545	0.21164164609343109	0.1882839994125743

Software Development Manager People often mention that life in Amazon is stressful, on-call load, work life balance issues etc. Trust me that's all wrong. I am in Amazon for close to 5 years now and I really enjoy working at Amazon. I am motivated every day to go to work and solve some real complex issues related to business or tech, and what keeps me motivated is the peers, team, senior leaders that you work with. Amazon has the best workforce at all levels and you get to learn a lot from them and become successful in your career. Amazon takes care of work life balance, lots of employee benefits, work culture is the best. When I joined Amazon almost 5 years back I had heard similar stuff about slogging, work life balance etc. but it all turned out to be wrong and I am happy that I took the right decision at that time and did not go with what rumors I had heard. Politics at higher level, and that's part of every other company.	0.17087389025030256	0.2199586471359548	0.20599706011519317	0.2081907215875562	0.19497968091099332

Apple is an amazing company to work for. Apple Retail is unlike any other retail job. Not only are you encouraged to learn, you are also given time (paid) to do so.

So far, Amazon is the best company I've worked for It's been #1 in Shopping but Amazon has been expanding beyond and growing fast in AWS, Alexa, etc. A truly innovative company that knows how to provide the best experiences to the customers in the right way. Amazon keeps breaking records!  Amazon has a unique culture based on Leadership Principles that encourage employees to be the true owners of whatever you develop for the customers. This is a very solid foundation behind the growth. People perceive Amazon as a place people are pushed too hard on their work. This is because Amazon has the best talents working across the globe.

Warehouse Associate Easy work for a warehouse and pay is pretty decent for the kind of job it is.

A grown up place to work Big challenges. Bigger ideas and bigger yet opportunities to own your work. Speaking up and taking responsibility is expected. Customers are at the center of every conversation, every decision. You can and are expected to speak to whomever you need to to get things done. You are expected to try and even fail. Failure and invention are inseparable. Company encourages employees to explore their career across the enterprise. So you can change jobs without changing companies. Not like other companies but many people will not realize that until they trip over it. Growing super fast and that means growing pains.	0.15573541580454225	0.19775981215474694	0.23303058448613903	0.2345366258338676	0.17893756172070424

'Evangelical' Clean. Safe. Hard working team. Vast resources for development. Hypocrites, rave on about hiring 'personalities', yet after a short period of time you must conform to maximise (output) - essentially: "it is what it is". Considering the amount of information to retain and work ethic, pay not competitive. Didn't like the whole "this product is great because..", a personal note but regardless of what products were pushed out you had to believe it could almost cure cancer.	0.18596750419641325	0.21032869306745425	0.1899454145379958	0.22490912434166024	0.1888492638564765

Pros and Cons Great benefits. Solid Comp plans. Compelling CEO. Smart People. Lots of middle management lifers that have forgotten how to work, and simply play the bureaucracy and politic games to stay alive.

Amazon Local: Not the place for you When I started I had wonderful coworkers. The benefits are incredible. The office space is very sleek & startup-like. Lots of vacation time.

Phenomenal The people, the mission, the way the company respects its employees. Everyone here is super pumped about work, but in a way where team work is prioritized over individual ambitions.

Whether you're here to collect a check or climb the ladder, this is an excellent workplace. Amazon is one of the few companies which, in addition to developing effective production metrics and encouraging continuous process innovation, has created a way of quantifying associate engagement and satisfaction with their Area Manager. Amazon values the happiness of its workers and is committed to the values of servant leadership. Depending on how well an associate's physical and intellectual abilities match with their job placement upon hiring, their daily experience of working at Amazon can be wildly disparate with other entry-level associates. It can be difficult to cultivate the best performance from associates who may be stagnant in or ill-equipped to perform their given function when cross-training is what they want and need but is not available at the time.	0.1814130681733199	0.23110141796415462	0.20682630326928694	0.22184317153844027	0.1588160390547983

Great place as long as you're on the right team Amazing company with massive growth New York office has incredible culture RSUs that, once vested, can secure your financial future Lots of really smart colleagues Challenging, motivating work People eat, sleep and breathe the leadership principles (this is good or bad, depending) Lots of international travel opportunities They invest heavily in training, so lots of opportunity to grow If you can prioritize you can set your own schedule but you are the only one who can set those boundaries for yourself. The culture can be an adjustment. No powerpoints internally, all presentations are done via written narrative. Seattle trips can be nerve wracking. Lots of pressure from teams there. They take data-drive to a whole new level - "opinions don't matter unless backed up by facts." OP1 and OP2 times of the year can be stressful, colleagues are expected to rip apart your plans in all-hands meetings so you have to be prepared for anything and everything. There tends to be a lack of vision on some teams - the expectation is that you'll identify problems and create your own solutions.	0.07880937462124898	0.14167570334210755	0.299312288069303	0.27750894186314495	0.20269369210419555

Come here if you want to make an impact. I joined facebook coming from 8 years in the Financial Services industry. Wow, what a world of difference. 2 biggest pros come to mind:  - Openness. Do you have an issue with a colleague or something facebook is doing? No problem. Take care of it. Facebook encourages its employees to be open and give feedback for things they think should be improved.  - Do you want to see your impact on 1 billion users? Come to facebook. Although I'm not in engineering, I work with a lot of software engineers, including interns, who constantly talk about the things they work on and how they love showing these off to their friends and family. - Being 7 months new, I am still in the process of thinking of areas of improvement.	0.15609842197090038	0.17671128229967487	0.28608563459513736	0.23431039308147128	0.14679426805281617

High stress and expectations, but fun and challenging Lots of perks (free gear, best in class equipment), very smart peers. Innovation is encouraged. The ranks are filled with very smart people who live interesting lives. High stress and lots of politics. It can be quite difficult to advance once you reach the higher levels. Even with tens of billions in the bank, there is little sense of job security -- your project may be canceled at any time, and it is your responsibility to find an alternate work group or you are let go.	0.165247671467722	0.2244910538357038	0.21024177823631168	0.20102211847946647	0.19899737798079611

Titles don't reflect the work you actually do Amazing boss. I am challenged with the work that I do. I love the flexibility in work hours and dress code. I feel that I can just come and do the work no matter the time or what I look like. Company has become to big.

Seems like it's always the best time to be here Everything in engineering is cutting edge. The projects we get to take on are huge, and there's lots of learning to be done. The decisions for engineering are made by me, not handed down by someone else. The culture is also made by me, not handed down by someone else. (As an individual, you own the experience/culture/projects at FB just as much as anyone else does)  Currently, I have an awesome manager who is helping me to personally grow as well.  Also, it seems like all of the cultural decisions that were made by the m-team here are extremely well thought out. They always seem to be the most natural / reasonable decisions None yet. My work life balance on my own was never that consistent. I would work really hard some days, and not do much the other days.

The greatest place ever I've been blown away by how incredible this company is. From its openness to its diversity, Facebook has truly surpassed all tech companies in terms of culture, perks, and employee lifestyle.

No! Depends on who is reading this. They will hire anyone. You have medical insurance on day one though, as long as you are a full-time employee. Everything else. The culture there is pathetic. The pay sucks considering the bull you have to put up with. Expect to hear your rates every hour (which seems to increase constantly). Rates, that's all they care about. Your a robot, not a human being. I have not been there but 5 months, but most people leave after a month (if they don't leave after the first week). I was told they have a 300%turnover rate? Not sure if that is correct, but I can see how it could be true.	0.1899638175696611	0.15811633587630783	0.20811311541559316	0.15854530043375864	0.28526143070467935
Amazing company at the bleeding edge of media Amazing company culture, ultra aligned vision, fantastic talented and motivated colleagues, entrepreneurial and "hacker" culture is very strong.

Pays lip service to putting employees first, doesn't deliver. Interesting work that was different all the time. Lots of interaction between different departments. Good benefits as far as Health Insurance was concerned. Poor base compensation for position, relies too much on stock grants to make up pay. No work-life balance at all and if you are religious, you're frowned up (at least at the location I was at) if you as to have Sunday mornings free. Being moved out of areas of responsibility once you get really good at them and can add value.  While they stress people are important, if you try to work with people if they have issues, your reprimanded about trying to help them. It seems like they would rather just get rid of them and hire someone else.

Digital growing pains working to create new digital experiences and new platforms is cool, get to work with some smart people, brand recognition of amazon is great, stock price is doing well. HR/Performance management systems are stuck in the 90's and don't encourage growth or risk taking. Middle management is under trained and in experienced - folks getting promoted based on politics and connections not on skills. Lack of people investment, people are worked hard and get burnt out.

19 years at Microsoft Overall a great place to work with a very extensive breadth of opportunities for career growth. The company is strong but your satisfaction will be heavily dependent on your immediate work group and unfortunately there are a number of groups that have unhealthy groups. Be very careful with the team you choose to join. It is difficult to get into a number of groups unless you are highly technical and when you do you may find it difficult to deliver because of the lack of ability to communicate by those in management.	0.1864007075296463	0.19394576942198422	0.23000269730955544	0.22847119699296828	0.16117962874584565

Though Apple has a great vision and overall culture, the retail environment in this store is pretty bad. People don't even say hi to you when you walk into work most of the time. The opportunity to advance is also a bit challenging when you get toward management and they don't necessarily make it easy for you.	0.1932941522767654	0.24714805402201626	0.18253362327539424	0.24903681277181228	0.1279873576540118
Underpaid, Underappreciated  I work with some amazing people Benefits are alright The company core values align with my own. In terms of customer privacy, human rights, etc. Retail hours micromanaged LOW pay for the expected work Once you reach Genius, there's NO room for advancement People are being put in technical positions just because they have been there awhile, or are friends with management. Training for new technicians is done "remotely" and consists of them self training in front of a computer for a week.

Great resume builder for your next role - great experience, kind of a sink or swim environment so being proactive and taking the initiave and quick learners are a huge plus. Either way, you are going to put in situations outside of you comfort zone. - Nice signing bonus, mediocre salary - great resume builder, especially for any candiates that came straight from college like me - Lots of responibilites so the work is more rewarding - Long hours, I had to open the building at 6:30am (my shift was 7am-5pm), didn't end up leaving til 6pm every nite - Even longer hours during "peak" season, I'm talking about ridiculous long hours like 6 days a week/12hr days for a couple months is normal during holiday peak season - The environment, between the managers, it is very competitive for your department to hit rates, this creates an environment where any manager will talk behind you back at your expense to make themselves look better - Yes you have vacation hours but using them is very unlikely, hard to take time off.

Slave Drivers....amazonian=robot (kiva) Consecutive 3 day-off schedule, there is always plenty of work, hence O/T opportunities. Poor training, you have to figure out everything by yourself. The management tells you "Teamwork", I have helped so many new associates to understand the procedure & trained them, but management have come up to me & said 'My rate is low", I have a written warning. Could you believe it? They tell you "a teamwork is a must" & then they nail you. Of course, they do not give you a credit when you help the other people. They are bunch of idiots!... No work-life balance for 4 working days, compensation is not minimum wage but they push you work to off-limits & they suck your all energy at the end of the day. Walking & standing up (absolutely no sitting) for 11+ hours, too tiresome job, too cold in winter & extremely hot in summer time. Unfriendly, cold-looking, noisy, dirty & dusty work environment. The warehouse setting looks like a modern prison with the exception that males & females together. The management treats you like a number not like a person. They constantly remind you your performance rates through out the day, they play lots of games, all managers are bipolar & have two faces. I have never seen so many tired, cranky, miserable & unhappy workmates together in my life. Obviously nobody likes this job. The management always threaten you that they can fire you in any day. The list goes on & on, just horrible place to work. I am so happy I no longer work here. Indeed, I would like to thank you very much amazon.com & my temp agency ISS to release me from the job (prison), I really appreciate it. You have done a big favor me !...

Inspirational Workplace Benefits aside, the best thing about working at Facebook is the people. It is very rare to be the "smartest person in the room". There is always someone who is better than you at something. This makes Facebook a great place to grow your skills and learn new things. This is made even easier by the friendly and open environment. Many employees are young and ambitious, which is great. However, one downside to this is that people are eager to push themselves to prove what they are capable of - Facebook is a place where talented people can shine. This can lead to a self-imposed work/life misbalance.	0.17369132182287628	0.21909207833649647	0.20621083734014872	0.20833733565410525	0.1926684268463732
Worst training EVER! At first glance the benefits are descent and so is the starting pay, until you hit the floor and realize even at twice the rate it isn't enough to be put through the stress. Zero choice in shift, zero work life balance, work measurements based on random case allocation and you are penalized for partner sites errors in transfer and poor customer service. Inconsistency is rampant, be prepared for being told 5 different answers for the same policy questions all of which are incorrect, no worries for them it's your work that suffers not theirs. There is rampant favoritism and it's not based on skill level, having a superior attitude and belligerent interaction with peers paves the way for advancement. Darwinism may rule here, but clearly some gene pools should remain untapped.	0.27063705793682247	0.1298916929206396	0.26849695357470577	0.21685516535898453	0.11411913020884759

New review system is counter-productive The benefits are great: raises, stock awards, charitable gift-matching, etc. There are many very intelligent people with whom you can collaborate. Field engineers get to work from home. Great place for people who like playing with the latest and greatest tech and software. Stack-ranking is gone, but the new review system is just as bad. In the old system, 10% of the team had to be given the lowest score, even if they were all great employees. Now, no one know how the system really works. It appears that the managers get to do whatever they want. If you can't demonstrate "impact", you'll get pushed out the door. The problem is that there is no definition of what "impact" can be. It is all up to your manager. If you don't have a good manager, then you are in trouble.	0.17985703511834927	0.1988575187935232	0.20385228506306385	0.23170196195744933	0.18573119906761434

Well balanced for life, interesting work, but not sure of the company's vision At Microsoft you work on products that are used by many people, and it's a huge rush to know that your code will be used millions of times. Work-life balance is better than any of my friends that work in similar roles at different companies. The pay is competitive, and the medical benefits until recently were best of the bunch. You are working for the evil empire, assimilated by the borg, however you want to be told you've sold out you're probably going to hear it. Microsoft has a pretty bad rep, especially amongst the CSci crowd. Sometimes you might not agree with the direction the company seems to be moving in.	0.17745391953659131	0.20069985418747313	0.22577157830428962	0.21587089561318415	0.18020375235846192

One hell of a place to fall into a a lifelong groove. Stellar resources. Amazing compensation and benefits. The hours can be long, but the emphasis on work life balance is part of the company culture. Google can be just a little stuck up. I worked with Google as part of an company acquisition and the hazing went far beyond the pale - they took out a banner ad targeted at my company with a picture of a pig so discouraging us from eating at their company cafeteria!	0.14226830701617177	0.22396775299591784	0.21145313771174634	0.2199454150016949	0.2023653872744693
Amazon has it's ups and downs, and high risk reward, like the Seahawks! Amazon is doing amazing things in so many areas: media, cloud, fulfillment, hardware, grocery, Fire/Kindle. The stock growth over time is great bonus too. Having multiple managers in a short period of time combined with moving between teams, resets the upward mobility opportunities.  From 3 counts of personal experience (plus colleagues), management failed to take major life changing moments (i.e., birth or a death in the family) into account when allowing for time to celebrate or grieve. Meaning they didn't have a backup plan to cover for employee that was on a leave of absence. So instead of covering, they asked new parent or grieving employee to continue to perform at high level immediately following life changing experiences.	0.16107668181872167	0.2832364190400348	0.21683917939282538	0.22500661782769316	0.11384110192072507
Great opportunity, only if you strive hard You will find opportunities here, if you work hard. You also get to learn lots of technical skills, across various areas. Working hour is flexible in my team (it may vary in different team), in the sense that you don't have to get to work at early morning, and you can freely WFH if you like, given that you finish your work.

Administrative Business Partner - Sales Fantastic benefits. It's great to have Google on your resume. Directors will never understand what you do on a daily basis in this role. Your performance review isn't based on a scale, but instead it ends up being based on a pass/fail opinion. A poor director/admin fit means that the admin will suffer. Admins have to step up to offer emotional/career support for each other because there is not an internal management system in place specifically for them. You will need to give 110% every day because 100% is never enough.	0.23906325015106333	0.12377320178974847	0.19243414520906785	0.3093331774019991	0.13539622544812124

Great Product - Great People - Great Culture The Salt Lake City, UT site is an inbound Call-Center where both Chat & Voice agents help customers with general product questions, troubleshooting and resolving Netflix issues (Accounting and Technical) with english speaking customers only, from all countries where Netflix is available.  You are challenged daily to become better at your job, and you're given the tools and the training to do exactly that! You're coached weekly and your leaders are great motivators and great people to interact with. It's like everyone gives a damn about their careers, and their own personal growth as well as YOUR career and personal growth!  Other Perks: Great wages, 401k, very affordable Health Insurance (after your temp agency contract is over and they convert you to full-time Netflix). The building I work in is pretty great. It's a fun and colorful atmosphere with a lot of 20-and-30-somethings working hard and having fun! Around every corner is some kind of Netflix branding that's related to one of their shows, like Orange Is The New Black, or House of Cards. There's a cafeteria that cooks fresh food for you during the day (Vegetarian options included!). And Netflix covers half the cost of the meals so you can get really great lunches on the cheap! Free coffee (there's even an espresso machine to make your own lattes - also free!). And there's occasionally Netflix swag given out, like windbreakers, water bottles, even Netflix labeled sweatpants! It's easily the best place I've ever worked! If you don't give a damn about your career or your own development, you won't last long. The talent pool is also extremely saturated with highly skilled people, which makes it very challenging in terms of promotions.  Because it's a call-center, there can be a bit of turnover with the staff. This is pretty common for call centers in my experience, and terminations always seem to happen for the same reason: Attendance  If you get terminated for attendance, it's because you were prone to missing work frequently. They will also let you go if you're a tool to your customers on the phone calls you take. A good rule is don't swear at, or start freaking out at them. Follow this and you should be fine. You're graded on your Customer Satisfaction levels and how active you are at putting in the practice to get better. If you're not getting better at your job, or you're not working on the areas where you need improvement, you'll get let go. But your Supervisors are pretty good at telling you exactly what needs work, and they work with you to get to where you need to be. And if you're in any danger of getting terminated, either due to your performance or your attendance, your Supervisors are pretty upfront about it, giving you plenty of fair warning as well as an opportunity to turn it around. Generally speaking, if you get fired from this place, it's because you either didn't care, or you didn't show up.	0.1890163205869138	0.21496742132681904	0.1958699597674563	0.211906666470766	0.18823963184804476
Not what I'd expected Great people. People for the most part generally care about customers needs and each other. Great opportunity for a younger person (25 and younger) looking for a career.

Salary, bonus and benefits are great. Like any job, you get what you put into it. This doesn't mean having to work crazy hours. A good work life balance can be achieved, you just need to be proactive about it. There are many naïve people out there that still see Microsoft as Micro$oft, the money hungry corporate giant that wants to take over the world.

Suffocating culture and NOT what  They have food at the office I was hired under the impression that the cloud team I was joining was transparent, and supported by leaders. There is NO flexibility, no work life balance (though it is 'said' that is). When you do something you were asked to, you are then in hot water for not doing something different. Expectations change without warning, and management does not have your back when it comes to the hard work you've done, because they need to focus on how they look rather than how you look to the rest of the upper levels.	0.1598859241830447	0.2230130493388449	0.21582068779931987	0.2676717328899964	0.13360860578879405

Good company, getting too big and far too competitive Great brand, great products, great founders/exec mgmt, awesome benefits. Getting too big and bureaucratic, and hence very difficult to have real impact. Most VPs have been around for ~10yrs, so basically churning old leadership without too much new blood - and the old guard are not open to hearing new views, and usually surround themselves with like minded folks. Teams (my experience has been in sales ops and support..gTech internally) are "non-Googley" i.e. reward results vs how these results are achieved. This is a top-down culture. Most sr. mgrs and directors are not good leaders or people managers - lots of cliques, politicking, and naysayers are quickly rejected off the team. Google culture is being compromised.	0.18484849104819848	0.21022736731621625	0.1991152003041749	0.22172001295456353	0.18408892837684673

My seven years at Microsoft Working @ Microsoft can be out of this world. Especially Main Campus. There is nothing else that really compares or even comes close to the experience. The diversity of people (be it cultures, age groups, backgrounds, genders, education) is amazing. Even the products that Microsoft creates is diverse. Compare that with Google or Facebook who only make advertising revenue. Your experience will vary between teams, but one thing that was consistent (for me, at least) is that most of my time was spent focusing on politics and processes. Though I had the opportunity to work on some popular products, the only way I could ever get my work done (according to expectations) is if I stayed late in the day (most of the time was spent in meetings, dealing with build processes, iterating specs with the team, answering literally hundreds of e-mails a day, helping test team troubleshoot issues) -- unfortunately, a lot of this does not really get accounted in your workload, and in those cases where it does, it's almost impossible to correctly estimate how long those things will take, since it relies on your entire team to work 100% efficiently. I believe work/life balance is actually possible here, but it's only at the expense of getting a positive review. Accountability is important, but most of the time, it felt like I was taking the blame (or being punished for) someone else's poor performance on the team. At the same time, you don't want to point fingers, because it makes you look equally bad. Really the only time I was happy was when I was working late to make everything seem like it was on schedule, or I was on a team with no slackers. Sometimes people would not hold up their end of the workload (say if they were more junior people in their role) and management would expect you to help them do their job, but would not properly account for this in the estimates.  Over time I eventually learned to manage these things better with politics. Yes, people who have worked in corporations already are familiar with this problem, but at Microsoft, the politics are significantly magnified. People are super smart here and are always trying to make their job easier and take advantage of people who are not as politically savvy. Therein lies the true problem. I eventually left Microsoft, since it felt like most of my time (almost 70%) was spent politicking and handling processes. Coupled with a decrease quality in the products (the gradual results of their work environment) and a lot of other, good people leaving the company. Microsoft seemed to be going downhill.  Though Enterprise and Azure have really taken off recently, I don't think it will be enough to compensate for the decline of Windows revenue in the end. Surface was an unfortunate flop, and Windows Phone + Bing are sucking money from the company. Xbox 360 was doing great when I left, but now even Xbox One is looking like a poor performer, which is really concerning for the company as a whole, when you combine these things together. Office and Azure are really the only areas left that see significant potential and though Office 365 has showed promise, its revenue is really not enough to make up for the loss in Office desktop sales that are surely to come with the decline of Windows desktops.  So please be careful. It's no surprise they had layoffs recently. Despite most of them being in the Nokia division (because of the Nokia merger) still a considerable chunk of few people in Redmond (even top performers) were simply laid off because of the group they happened to be in. They were forced to leave or re-interview for a new positions in the company (which really does not work in your favor when many others are also interviewing due to of the lay offs). A similar approach was used in 2009. It was devastating to morale. Coupled with the "layoffs continuing to happen over the course of the year" really would not recommend anybody apply to Microsoft at least until late 2015.  The company is undergoing significant changes though to make it self "more efficient." But it's too soon to tell what that really means. Some people suspect that this will be the people who exercised their work/life balance, while at the same time, they will like increase the number of foreign workers who are willing to work the really crazy hours.  None of this is encouraging. Luckily, these days there are much better place to work and have a good life balance.  So now is definitely *NOT* the time to consider Microsoft. Look elsewhere and maybe reconsider in late 2015 is my humble recommendation.	0.2698212483696986	0.1404115171491924	0.2044961040275611	0.27503270236379523	0.11023842808975248

Too political and lack of diversity Benefits, community, opportunity to learn new technologies. It is all about software and you work with really smart people. You have your own office. I am a woman and I like that Microsoft partners with women organizations. Too political. If you want to have a career at Microsoft you need to have a sponsor. It doesn't matter how good you are at what you do and how intelligent you are. It doesn't matter your reputation outside. You need to build a reputation inside and always have one or more sponsors. It is also a very competitive environment and they privilege competitiveness over collaboration besides they say and "promote" the contrary. That can become very stressful because you have to work really hard and many of your peers will try to discredit you and that gets worse when the review period is closer. Microsoft also doesn't do a good job regarding diversity. I see it as a quite homogeneous ecosystem. In many of the groups (I won't say all because I only worked in a few) most of the employees are Indian males and the very few women are mostly Indian or Arabian and they are usually shy, don't speak up (maybe that explains why there are so few senior women). I am a woman coming from a more liberal culture and I really feel intimidated by this. Don't take me wrong, I don't have anything against any particular culture, it is just the lack of diversity that I don't like. I don't feel I have much in common with most of the people I work/worked with here.	0.17233510259686857	0.163592204687681	0.22571603019160774	0.24034631980081234	0.19801034272303047

Obvious pros, but cons are real Top compensation and benefits, working with people who are the best at what they do and push you to do your best work, company trusts their employees, lots of visibility from senior management. Reviews cause an unhealthy amount of anxiety among employees, sink or swim environment. Managers are expected to be in this role because they like people management and there is no additional comp for this role nor does the amount of time spent managing or mentoring get reflected in reviews. This creates a situation where there is little incentive to be a great manager and many of them are more focused on their own career growth. Work/life balance on many teams is terrible. There's a lot of lip service about it, but it continues to be a huge problem.	0.18126094570928195	0.30210157618213657	0.18126094570928195	0.2416812609457093	0.09369527145359019

Horrible but not quite as bad as financial companies One word: money. The compensation, including the stock, is very good, and there aren't many other places that pay so well. The benefits are OK too but you need to be careful: for example, they have good insurance policies but by default they push you towards the bad ones. Everything else. The offices are placed in the cities. Horrible commute, non-stop parking troubles. The offices themselves are horrible, very densely packed. It's the only place I've seen that has more densely packed offices than the banks. When you sign up, you don't get to know, what group you'll be assigned too. The job itself is incredibly stupid, you're guaranteed to be vastly overqualified for it. The smugness level is amazing, the smug is so thick you can cut it with a knife. There are worse places to work (i.e. banks) but for the technical companies it's a deeply substandard one. No wonder that the people who stay there for a long time are mostly the new grads, who haven't seen anything better.	0.18279242937945703	0.15790571430508646	0.22997474875774485	0.203413337717011	0.22591376984070063

There is no growth. All lies just to keep you motivated to keep doing well so they capitalize off your talents while they do nothing. 30% of my store ( and long term tenured ) left in the course of 3 months or so. - terrible scheduling - bad quality of life - never two days off in a row.

Like No Other Company - There are literally no limits. You can have an idea, oversee it, and realize it to fruition inside of 6 months. - Culture emphasizes clarity and specificity. Transparency and straightforwardness are valued above all, and room for BSing is significantly more limited than other large organizations. People communicate in highly literal terms, and the more simple you sound the more well-respected you are. This really is my favorite thing about Amazon: there's no reward for garbage consultant lingo that sounds good but is really just hot air. You get to just describe stuff like you would to a 10-year old (in a good way), and you get to say 'I don't know' pretty bluntly when you don't know. That's incredibly rare. - It's easy to move around between teams. - Caliber of people around is high. People are significantly smarter than the average in any of the companies I've worked at previously. Different galaxy than where (e.g.) Microsoft in terms of employee caliber. - You'll learn more than you ever thought possible. - Not for folks who want to coast their way through their careers. It's for highly motivated people who want to exercise change (of a product, an experience, a process, a customer expectation). The recent spotlight on Amazon's culture is mainly driven by folks who came to Amazon under the assumption that because it has now scaled it'll be way easier to just not work very hard. That's a fallacy. You can certainly work at Amazon while having a family to care for, but you need to have some flexibility and understand that some days will be unusually demanding. - Sometimes folks get too caught up in the process instead of the product. - Since it's scaling enormously, room for politicking has increased. But it's still far short of the usual for a Fortune 10 company.	0.18323102682959563	0.19270887941214362	0.23792023773573992	0.21160446894082005	0.17453538708170077

Growing pains of a company becoming huge. Good comradely among the engineers. Very customer focused. You can pretty much kill any bad idea with "customers will hate it" argument.  Agile program management means you'll keep up with what your team members are doing on a daily basis.  Nearly everything is client/service architecture. Which if your team does it well, allows your to do whatever is best for your solution to your problem area without having huge migration issues with your clients.  Generally managers are too busy to have those useless weekly meetings. (If you have daily ones why have a regular weekly one? You can always schedule a topic meeting to go over design issues etc.)  Good and getting better support for bicycling to work. (bike cages, showers, lockers, and towels)  Discount on buying stuff on their website. On call. Nearly every engineering team has an on call rotation, so count the number of members and divide the number of days in a year by that number and that's the number of days you'll be on "house arrest" Because a page must be answered within 20 minutes any time day or night when you are on call.  There seem to be more frameworks than teams. Everyone wants one and they tend to get imposed on your project in order to interface to some other needed service. Then the company drops support for it and you'll have to migrate your service.  Difficult to do volunteer coding, ie help with your favorite freeware system, as you need approval from legal. It's not impossible but it's not straightforward either.  Annual reviews tend to emphasis the negative vs the positive, that is you have peer feedback but your manager can pick and choose among the comments to either promote you or squash you. Very little opportunity to complain about it via HR.	0.15165564909850157	0.19257914150733046	0.22692593311211276	0.22839252102327626	0.20044675525877897
Good company to intern for It definitely felt like there was a lot of mobility (in terms of moving between teams). Also, everyone I spoke to was really willing to help out with my onboarding issues, and other questions down the line!

Great place to work. Fun, great people for the most part. The ones you don't care for (very few) you can stay away from but overall great people. Can be a bit clique-y at times- like in high school with the "cool kids". Day flies by quickly because you are always busy. If you are part-time it's tough to have another gig. They suck up as much of your time as they can, often at the most inconvenient hours when you need to do other gigs. Other than that there are few "cons".	0.2119093338437695	0.2085059580688201	0.15129068118392042	0.21426002434949026	0.21403400255399968

Endless amounts of challenges and opportunities Strong entrepreneurial culture that fosters independence and proactivity. This translates in small talented teams that can makes things happen. And funnily it's a very open and connected organization, no red tape in sight.
