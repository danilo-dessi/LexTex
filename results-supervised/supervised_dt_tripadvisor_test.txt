The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away.	0.35140813299484547	0.2796151822089979	0.19522645592411556	0.1737502288720412
She did not say anything good about the shop, but simply said they do diving.	0.35140813299484547	0.2796151822089979	0.19522645592411556	0.1737502288720412

My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
We came there expecting to dive onsite, not have to drive 30 minutes to a dive shop that may or may not be reputable.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
The first night we woke up at midnight because the people were talking and when they sneezed at 6:00 am it was so loud I thought someone was in our room.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

However, during high season this might not be possible.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

I guess the bottom line is that if you are a diver and plan to dive, I would not stay there.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival (late, with tired students) we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it.	0.08643944625282986	0.3156997476035366	0.4016879697203222	0.1961728364233113
We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

Positives: gorgeous landscaped grounds in the midst of the paddy fields; beautiful villas; wonderful breakfasts (the home-made bread with home-made jam was delicious); extras such as free mini-bar, free laundry and transfers into town (15-minute drive); lovely spa; fantastic infinity poolNegatives: internet never worked and staff didn't understand why it wasn't acceptable that 50% of websites (including all online newspapers) were blocked by their server; extremely high prices in the restaurant (why should main courses be 2-3 times as expensive as very chic restaurants in Seminyak?);	0.24420688610598457	0.1943152321867817	0.2472415378705452	0.31423634383668864
the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.	0.3224494581749383	0.2565727868401399	0.32645639603338805	0.09452135895153387
Ubud itself has a lot to offer, great shopping and sightseeing and restaurants, but does get very over-crowded and in the daytime is simply a massive traffic jam.All in all, the Chedi would be great if you truly need to get away from it all - staying in your villa, lounging by the pool, eating fine meals (at a huge mark-up but probably still cheaper than London or New York).	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997

Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed.	0.3027948780887809	0.24093365252302706	0.3065575771090422	0.14971389227914997
