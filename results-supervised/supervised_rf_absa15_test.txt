This computer periodically crashes (Office, IPhoto, Safari). It takes a long time to get on the Web and to change Web Sites. Locks up she searching for updates. Just to be clear. I have been an Apple user since they switched to Intel. I have had Macbook PROs and Macbook Airs and have never had a problem. It seems that this computer might be a lemon. I purchased it through Amazon. I have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support. I am taking the computer to Apple to see what they think.	0.39037753778934114	0.20214193301810618	0.06253063457240357	0.09730978217683174	0.0	0.007454966629670658	0.07953548531282248	0.1202999508787093	0.04034970962211482
I purchased my Macbook Pro Retina from my school since I had a student discount, but I would gladly purchase it from Amazon for full price again if I had too. The Retina is great, its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the SSD storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well. But if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile.	0.2426876066590935	0.15320502808010394	0.24722575848427053	0.1307272558760876	0.0	0.02712183000005995	0.0	0.0010107182510322016	0.19802180264935232

I just bought this computer from the Apple Store, and I couldn't be more impressed with it. It has a stunning retina display, and is very fast. The solid-state memory makes it a lot faster than previous MacBook Pro models that used a spinning hard drive. This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations. Also, the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear, and everything is just sleek and smooth. The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me. No hardware issues, as is common with any Apple product. Great product, and couldn't be happier with it.	0.24815350606096787	0.25545995884868966	0.2534222071827465	0.10839373346843972	0.0	0.005938399980631912	0.09503332769352993	0.03297283942392387	0.0006260273410705745

I love my new ThinkPad! It gives me everything I need from a computer and with the long lasting battery, it also gives me mobility. I can use it anywhere. It was a great purchase.	0.446110517675823	0.09349205715725703	0.11426443956790985	0.1088787237650277	0.0	0.09840549152851896	0.04544525887353686	0.09250540625343776	0.0008981051784889085
All the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a Thinkpad. Average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly. Below average on the w-fi adapter which I'm still trying to get to the bottom of. If the wi-fi adapter will not support duplex operation (still trying to get to the bottom of that) that's a noticeable drawback I'll be grousing about for the entire time I use it.	0.3666429620284633	0.058956144056182075	0.37703238861142424	0.06321078118218278	0.04158629668405078	0.04846314009950392	0.0	0.04328644432680072	0.000821843011392123

A good value for the money. Quite pleased with it. Fast enough for my purposes. No bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall. Excellent keyboard and crisp screen. Battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of RAM so that is a trade off I suppose. I'm glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days.	0.2867223943474292	0.10659944879746241	0.3252134581099072	0.047469816073187426	0.0	0.13462537241597292	0.0	0.0013295506892494482	0.09803995956679153
The laptop itself is very good, it could be better, but not bad at all for it's price point. It does everything I need. The big deal with this was Windows 7. I had searched everywhere for a Windows 7 laptop, and all I could find was that awful Windows 8. When I saw this I grabbed it. It has met all my needs.	0.2615961401262527	0.10428884966010095	0.018997233863406116	0.16496526230370864	0.0	0.1006190150934175	0.03167297639347913	0.032803735018322754	0.28505678754131214

Performs as advertised, if not better! Super light weight (I never cared either way about weight until now). Feels like solid state. WONDERFUL machine; glad I bought it. Tiny, forgivable drawback - no ethernet cable outlet. But that's not a deal-breaker. SUPER LAPTOP!!

Great price and computer! I bought this laptop computer for my parents, they only access their facebook and e-mail accounts, see family pictures, etc. They loved it. It's easy to operate and it's very light (my parents are almost 60 yo, they can't carry a heavy computer while traveling). But here's something I hadn't realized before buying it: there isn't an optical drive, which means NO CDs or DVDs!	0.20844390609885965	0.029427055221107657	0.053235865406695906	0.15261693551680927	0.02123417157395405	0.04644895733212828	0.12740502944372428	0.1698733725916324	0.19131470681508841

I have so much trouble turning the computer on. It comes on for seconds then shuts itself off. My mistake was to not research this one, no DVD and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures.

For everyday use, you can't really go wrong with this laptop. If, like me, you will be paying bills, occasionally reading the news, or just buying stuff on line, Then this is a winner. If you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use, get something else. It's a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet. Like i said, Good for basic stuff and as a starter. Still getting use to Window 8. Has a built in camera which i do not use. Sturdy but only for typical wear and tear.	0.2501884118742058	0.10308209848933093	0.04929000643947239	0.2598396503697536	0.032007987013858846	0.14442939522333248	0.09602396104157652	0.06481820950330273	0.0003202800451668177

The keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the F-keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non-issue. it is a great value for what you get. i can run somewhat modern games like Skyrim and Fallout New Vegas with no issues.	0.5307004675373592	0.076643338386604	0.032426276486987086	0.0788144403136261	0.0	0.008641249918050896	0.10812486671326647	0.055983531495751464	0.10866582914835474
I get giddy every time I use this thing. It is a thing of beauty and fast enough. What's fast enough? When you click and don't wait. Waiting is horrible, and not waiting is the best thing on earth. So yes, it is ridiculously fast. The battery will get you from LA to NY no problem.	0.30620059255778426	0.04876125599819208	0.3473065081214246	0.11659265746523052	0.0	0.04047382263545808	0.06946130162428493	0.03578685145736289	0.03541701014026235

for the price this is a super product out of the box. It wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at $249. plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard. NO junkware!! This computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life(banling, facebook etc) and some basic offline work using MS Office. the only drawback is no DVD player.. but for $20 you can buy an external one	0.2236297360428971	0.03229642817609941	0.22781151404449293	0.2063704303697171	0.045562302808898586	0.035603017306679294	0.022781151404449293	0.023473953475518786	0.1824714663712475

beautifully done, the computer is amazingly faster compared to other version of macbook pro i have had in the past. I am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time. The battery life is good, even with using high profile software like Sibelius 7 for a good half of the day. Overall, the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price, which make this Apple purchase a worthwhile one.	0.27844712472883243	0.039315472617283936	0.28365396386124225	0.041522908767453105	0.0	0.1010610235194424	0.0	0.02907633541675204	0.2269231710889938

I upgraded the memory from 4gb to 8gb and found the user manual (which I read while awaiting the laptop to arrive) more useful than the Youtube demo.

Been using Lenovo ThinkPad Edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them. They have held up well not just in our sales department, but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust, exhaust, grease, oil, and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances. GENERAL, a quality laptop. The Lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you're not interested in it.	0.3967077248588402	0.13027580521868334	0.0877393084511103	0.1980014046300285	0.0	0.12570335802262372	0.0	0.060425157592233936	0.0011472412264801857

Great laptop from Apple! Apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality. The retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date. The pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface. Battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display. I can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge. Also, I find OS X much more simple and easy to use than Windows. Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.	0.14609457990702793	0.22119610699671569	0.08559194173175598	0.1629454217974762	0.03771892131675148	0.006237321819391	0.0	0.33947029185076333	0.0007454145801184158

Excellent performance, especially given its price point. It's performing very well after a week's use and I don't anticipate any trouble given my past experiences with Dell pcs. The screen is wide and provides excellent clarity. In addition to some usage on the road, this is also my desktop unit. It is not a small, compact laptop, but I won't be traveling via air often, so its size and weight is not a problem for me. This was recommended to me by an IT support specialist in the local school district. I can appreciate why she recommended it! If you are undecided between a desktop or laptop pc, I strongly recommend this pc as a solution.	0.2405370472997545	0.09011435470960544	0.194986152093374	0.16951885829939617	0.0	0.058061988128992145	0.05456559131625491	0.0009702649295537856	0.191245743223069

I live in Jamaica and bought this online and my husband took it down for me. So far I do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor. My son saw this laptop online and told be about it and i thought it was a good deal and bought it. I have had it over a month now and it works just fine. This laptop suits my needs: as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose. My daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us. So i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality, other than that it is a great buy!	0.22180042044700682	0.20409592039772892	0.0962724815435541	0.1228349229314519	0.0	0.15536180157046806	0.028376154291693496	0.02923910709479164	0.14201919172330502
This laptop is absolutely horrible. I bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser. There is a chance mine is defective but regardless I'm not going to try another one this is a terrible product. I'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014. I appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing Dell but just not worth it.	0.5017743160739438	0.08799189827219915	0.03850357823630146	0.07624202687985265	0.0	0.10032536177320983	0.06419476294872532	0.0019522395480856159	0.1290158162676821

the computer is very wonderful. was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it. it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw. but over all. im very satisfied. its very fast and very light. great product. i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing	0.2407288049752443	0.04951422579694216	0.34926186524520525	0.21523573617447883	0.0	0.07347567588562022	0.03492618652452053	0.036167281824396075	0.0006902235735927758
I absolutely love my Dell Inspiron! I use it for basic web browsing and word processing. I have also used it to watch YouTube and Hulu. It powers on/off very quickly, and it loads up automatically. The mouse click is a bit loud, but it really isn't a problem. For $250, I highly recommend!!	0.31596770938825786	0.1435457636832442	0.15690498682282938	0.054440040424770665	0.0	0.14880525179264462	0.0	0.03671371584672676	0.14362253204152645

This things run smoothly for its price, and the battery life seems to go on forever. I got this laptop as an upgrade / replacement for my old Lenovo notebook. I didn't have that much money, so I thought I'd give the Inspiron a try. I wasn't disappointed in its performance. All in all, it's well worth its price tag.	0.16950558917627898	0.08020856268509775	0.2466165801018691	0.08068981973535444	0.04932331602037382	0.07719833776656146	0.0	0.049841214412595376	0.2466165801018691
Great laptop for the price. It was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had A) a side keyboard. I do a lot of 10-key so I can't be pecking around at the top looking for numbers B) a DVD/CD player. I have a lot of antiquated programs that I use that require a download C) a large hard drive instead of using the Cloud D) was under $300 with shipping. The only con is Windows effin 8. Still giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen. Great for web design and general work.	0.1772396846133827	0.06535064250273619	0.22529146672146425	0.18225852090628353	0.0	0.10125086833388598	0.04505829334429285	0.02309755364788414	0.1804529699300704
Overall good but processing power isn't very good. W7 Pro with W8 pro upgrade is nice, but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there. I replaced stock drive with WD Black 7K drive and is still quite slow.

This laptop is amazing! Despite the fact that there's no optical drive, everything is perfect. The screen resolution is crystal clear, the speakers are amazing, and the track pad is easy to use. The home page/startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing I was mainly concerned about. Internet is fast and reliable, battery life lasts a long time.

Fantastic machine, I have never believed the hype behind Apple products, but must admit I am now a Mac user and do not see myself going back. There is somewhat of a learning curve, but the operating system, and hardware of this Mac are great. More than enough for my use. The display is vibrant and clear, the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on; I even installed a windows partition to be able to run Windows software. Things just work, they are fluid, easy to use and understand, fast and work well.	0.1684461956151312	0.06116218442246622	0.2688767867344766	0.0664722634356043	0.0	0.004446232792669714	0.08066303602034298	0.2688767867344766	0.08105651424483246
This computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing, watching video, word processing, and that's about it. If you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is NOT for you. Now when I say don't expect to play games on it, I mean it. Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor. Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports. It DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports, a hdmi port, and a webcam. The webcam is nothing special, its there if you need it. Don't expect it to take good pictures or video. The battery is pretty soild. It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use. The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed. I would strongly recommend to remove it and install Windows 7 on it with a usb drive. The performance will improve on it. Trust me.	0.2432664968601397	0.07658714072245083	0.15444404679857546	0.20149167053440706	0.0991261894712924	0.19880003744795108	0.0247815473678231	0.0010131291483153207	0.0004897416490451594
Not bad for the price. I needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine. Performance wise, it's a bit slow, but that's to be expected from a Celeron-class processor. I'm also not a fan of Windows 8, but fortunately I can install whatever I want on the laptop without issue.	0.18690918099453957	0.16366190955305	0.21345368000047657	0.1701958556642319	0.0	0.05135608280202186	0.0	0.0009696109852035647	0.21345368000047657

I love this laptop to the moon. My favorite colors black and red, the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard. The sound is great and it's fast. I had a number of updates to do and customization. The laptop is beautiful, not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard. The touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi FAST. Microsoft Office is a 30 day trial, a number of games and apps are already preloaded. It's exactly like the picture and I AM SATISFIED.	0.2541352649322173	0.010813264041070183	0.20710998635781144	0.18607090063987067	0.12944374147363216	0.05552433606391616	0.10355499317890572	0.026947142474939793	0.026400370837636595

This is going to be random and unorganized, but here are my thoughts on the laptop:So far so good after a month. It took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1, after being an XP user for many years. Everything seems to be running smoothly. Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software. They are fine while the free subscription is going, but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login. Device is light weight, quiet during operation and produces little to no heat. It has a quick start up and shut down time. The display is good quality. Just wish there were more USB ports.	0.2358944670227086	0.13845708709359794	0.2415389665105855	0.1655494419396608	0.0	0.05694133979660527	0.026756213285694608	0.054326115030291514	0.08053636932085562

It's so damn good I bought 2 :D If you're the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office, this is the laptop for you. Don't expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you. It's extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive (who uses those anymore anyways) so it easily fits into any college students bag. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't need much out of a computer.

Wifi card not working right out of the box. Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience. I have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them (over 4 different calls), only to get no where. Now I'm looking into the return process, which I'm sure will just be loads of fun, if my prior experience is any indication. Seriously, save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company. Used to love HP products, but this has soured me on the whole company.	0.36941530244450327	0.06094926544634724	0.07210148383961425	0.15816796341240882	0.23410661969098226	0.00877724970542127	0.0	0.0019141681243880966	0.09456794733633475
By far the best laptop I've ever had. Its fast, powerful, screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size. My only concern is that since the battery is not external, I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time. I wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol.	0.2876863894481009	0.1083041599349783	0.3263068647864382	0.10903822345895423	0.0	0.06944312286411479	0.032630686478643825	0.06594569393388235	0.0006448590948875202

Built in mike is really poor and unusable for Skype or any other purpose. And the only microphone input is for a combo Mike/Speaker plug. So to communicate I need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a built-in mike.

We haven't used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars, but so far it has been a very good laptop. Several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now I can understand why --- this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we've ever owned. I'm a life-long desktop computer user, and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a "normal" keyboard as I've ever seen. We like this new laptop -- a lot!	0.6334641402978187	0.026953421877191335	0.036610068260971414	0.09787183447695359	0.0	0.072800859272715	0.0	0.06649342802474231	0.06580624778960763
Very good performer for the price. Not blazing fast, but quick enough. One really nice thing about Lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software. The desktop was clean once I got it up and running. Battery life is above average, and it charges quickly. Keyboard is sturdy. The touch pad takes a little getting used to as the "click" buttons are on top instead of the bottom. I will be considering Lenovo for all future laptop purchases.	0.23980799470848396	0.09027956957720278	0.27200103228437505	0.0673351117193292	0.0	0.05748270488230847	0.027200103228437505	0.02802729091159759	0.2178661926882653
This lap top is good so far. It is quiet runs smoothly. I really like the video option on it, I stream movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix and there is no lag. Actually streams better than my regular desk top computer. The only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long, but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops I think. Now I lay a pillow on my lap first.

I just bought this laptop yesterday. This is how I feel about the laptop so far: 1.Great display. Love the color accuracy. 2.Very decent speakers. 3.Fairly fast. 4.Loud fan when watching 4K video off YouTube. Sounds like a washer. Machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. 5.Best to use the power supply for 4K video viewing. Battery power laptop had difficulties computing. 6.Still feels too heavy to me. Could lose another pound or two. 7.Expensive. Paid close to $2800 out the door. There are too many things to test.

Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. Bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a Dell in the past which was a great computer. This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered. It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes. I promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine. The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge. And I have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them! What a lemon!!	0.27316221728912277	0.24297734545312497	0.13230008298010879	0.08831545017507346	0.07988129912121367	0.1014783417648545	0.0	0.08109594206195832	0.0007893211545435746
This is a big disappointment. I only use a laptop for personal use, but this one can't even handle that! It takes a long time to load any page. I've had it for a minth and so far it's shut down completely 3 times. Had to call Dell to get it back online. I have had Dell Desktops for years, so had no qualms about buying a Dell laptop.

I've always sworn by dell. My very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me. It was stubborn as hell, no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it. It worked super fast and got the job done. So with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul. I am not ultra tech savvy but I can tell when it works slow! All I needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there. I barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load. I know its not my internet connection because I have an HP as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info I have on it. I'm so disappointed.	0.22673071542353804	0.23150915564437272	0.29460245635091703	0.04495831769563912	0.13093442504485203	0.036546202141645785	0.0	0.03407183466723141	0.0006468930318038343
Disclaimer: I'm a Mac user. I wanted to love this laptop, which I bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs, before my new university gave me one. In two months, both the power cord pin broke (the company replaced it) and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces. In addition, no matter what I do to change the settings, add/delete Flash, etc., Firefox hangs on start-up. It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on. The cords always feel like they are in my way. One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual. It's a pleasure to type on. My final thoughts: if you are a Mac user, stay away. If you want to travel with this laptop, don't buy it. It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down. If you have zero dollars, consider it. If you want ease of use and long-term happiness, buy a Macbook.	0.2594044427445962	0.1876478690510232	0.11555940249045041	0.0903330827412484	0.0	0.08252757562674508	0.05285103841483643	0.15869003503314877	0.0529865538979514

It's truly a great laptop for the price. I built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so I know what crazy performance on a computer can come to. However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value. It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me. I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well. BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards. If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming. Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing. Would definitely recommend for those who are "technologically ignorant"	0.3048007486423246	0.13073565251816383	0.1929846604312478	0.10595545833840164	0.0	0.13998592532939846	0.06199119778680407	0.03193821214091305	0.03160814481274631

Would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly. It was not responsive at all to touch. Very frustrating. And while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work, your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse. If they can fix this, I think it would be a very nice, cost-effective laptop.	0.43038504769279495	0.07713534094410039	0.03295284634813563	0.22613424671013138	0.0	0.0652396168261294	0.0	0.11212679844946935	0.056026103029238786
This laptop broke within the first hour of use. The 'A' key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn't press in. Dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes. Also, after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises. I'm sure I just got a bad egg, but instead of getting a replacement I decided to try a different one.	0.48243469049952514	0.3892616263314543	0.03282063020409341	0.030941112485527077	0.0	0.06122346472319761	0.0	0.0022370815392056907	0.0010813942169967973
This laptop is nice. It has a decent feel to it, sharp display and is fast enough. The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive. So frustrating!! I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped. Also, the touchpad is almost 'sticky', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad. I would love to keep this laptop, but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand. No Lenovo for me.	0.3089212909099244	0.04938723845343202	0.3483661259754695	0.11069152751484966	0.03483661259754695	0.07601132161788	0.0	0.03626081695118509	0.03552506597971236
Initially I liked the product so much. Although it was slow but I felt it was ok for the price you have bought it. But now I am having battery problems. Laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches 30%. I bought this laptop in November 2013. I am not satisfied with the product.	0.23593026079670756	0.01429725001297201	0.21473613287362056	0.08404540463659908	0.0	0.03937315937278325	0.03422998878847078	0.06931790442260978	0.308069899096237
It's an amazing laptop. Most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad. The laptop is fast. The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome. Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it's not got too slow either. I am loving it completely. It does make a little noise but that's alright as it's not too much. It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage. But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying. I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. HP please fix it. A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.	0.29767919927321085	0.10949830361270468	0.33568857986070516	0.08256333894992202	0.0	0.03843330319420171	0.10070657395821153	0.034767301581087845	0.0006633995699561152

Purchased it for my birthday and love it! I've been a loyal Dell user for quite some time. But every six months my Dell computer crashes. Since I also do a lot of writing and illustrations using Adobe products, I thought I would try a Mac. I'm so glad that I have. It's been a very easy transition moving my Windows created files over to the Mac. So far I haven't lost any quality or information. I have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts. But other than that, I really am loving the quality and speed.	0.23181858460092314	0.18419972257417838	0.21330487354369138	0.011904390701007694	0.0	0.028042345083972908	0.0	0.23615349047971584	0.0945765930165106

This is without a doubt the worst laptop I've ever had. I wavered between another Toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and I'm so sorry I did. And of course, the return window closed last week so now, I'm stuck with it. I will never buy another Lenovo anything! Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this. The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has. The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced. It hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly. I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open! Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left! I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense. Most of my things are stored in the cloud. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one! It's definitely not worth the money.	0.41922293084508583	0.23775076824640654	0.11931575029109029	0.1175544522889525	0.0	0.008913878058249695	0.0	0.04899621071387115	0.04824600955634396

Computer was DOA. Turned it on and it was beeping. Looked up the manual on another computer. The manual said that particular series of beeps indicated a video problem. Have the unit serviced. Lenovo sent me a box to return it to them. They claim they will have it back in six working days. We'll see. Once I get a working computer, I think I will like it.

So far I am very happy with this computer. It has everything I wanted-- built in Wi-Fi connectibility, a slot for my SD camera memory card, a DVD burner, big beautiful screen, plenty of USB ports (three 3.0 and one 2.0), and a keyboard with a nice touch. I liked the fact that it came with Windows 7, but also included Windows 8 to install later if I need it. The price was good. I use a wireless mouse, but the touch pad and the "red button" in the middle that works like a little "joystick" also work fine. I wish I had bought this sooner!	0.31106977017349285	0.07748211875141754	0.022590031982007774	0.017243689049581085	0.07532607692663168	0.08048317090238982	0.0	0.0764703517669457	0.33933479044753345
This is a great bargain. Yes, it's running and old type processor so, hey, don't even try gaming on it. But, if you are just an average user, it works really great. The screen is good, the whole things is very light and doesn't run hot. I'm very happy with it, typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that! I like everything about this laptop. It has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that's all I use anyway! I put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm. I plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked, no fuss no muss. It immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go. Excellent buy.	0.17445252012409182	0.1352902069802786	0.2215764220102455	0.20095169845205912	0.15510349540717183	0.08935628730202666	0.0	0.0006738404101861376	0.022595529313940356
The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon. Firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing. Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on. The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled. Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless. Get a probook instead.	0.2881539266854442	0.07631298332377348	0.17309539677505534	0.26381430506117487	0.0	0.06698217930653018	0.09749061507757181	0.0013285501285326378	0.03282204364191755

Hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far. The Mid-2014 MacBook Pro does no disappoint...

Meh...but cheap. I bought this so that I could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than iPad was offering. The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review... The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic. So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine. Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open. I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not. Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help. Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014. The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM. But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given? All in all I wish I had waited a bit. But then again hindsight is 20/20. Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet.	0.2016583921555115	0.15064775995448645	0.12257962146231981	0.26012107263965817	0.05780468280881292	0.06135417982480666	0.08670702421321938	0.001181597101131186	0.057945669840053934
This laptop is amazing! Windows 8.1 has its pros and cons. The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on. I was nervous at first that I purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard  backlight. Of course this will decrease your battery life. The sound is very nice and crisp. Also, I have no regrets about going with the 8GB RAM because its super fast. I'm still exploring the various features but overall I am satisfied with my purchase.	0.3029814819595837	0.07363810177774413	0.30864710281380875	0.21742473687106084	0.0	0.06489527427561581	0.0	0.0009386327682157587	0.03147466953397102
The HP Envy 15 has been everything I expected. After doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for, This one hit all the criteria I had. Amazon had the best pricing and the delivery was on time. The laptop is very responsice with the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop.	0.39256858283195895	0.2081076828337984	0.05329904942357345	0.16165017304222817	0.0	0.1823691529576535	0.0	0.0012154883664705133	0.0007898705443170128
